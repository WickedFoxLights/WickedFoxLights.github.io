For the purposes of this post, we'll be looking at only one of these circuits, one string of lights coming from one port; let's call this a run.</p><p>Some of the things which limit a run are the same as with other circuits: fuse(s) on the circuit (there's usually one built into the board per port), wire gauge, and wire length. On the Falcon F16, the ports have a 5A fuse, so we can't pass more current than 5A through this run without blowing the fuse. Wire gauge and length is.... complicated, so we're going to ignore it for the time being.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Cont_Wire_Chart.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Controller Port Limitations" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Cont_Wire_Chart.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Cont_Wire_Chart.jpg 924w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>see?</figcaption></figure><p>For <em>typical</em> LEDs, the amperage of each RGB pixel is approx 60mA, or 0.06A. This suggests that we can run about 83 pixels on each port, after which point we risk blowing the fuse on the board.</p><p>This is where things start getting.... weird. If you plugged in a string of 83 pixels and put them to full white (100% brightness to each red, green, and blue pixel), you'll notice that they look fine... up until around pixel 50 or so, at which point, they start taking on a pinkish hue. Virtually nobody would consider the color the 83rd pixel is emitting "white".</p><p>The reason for this dimming is because of a phenomenon called voltage drop. As you go down the line, each pixel consumes a little bit of power, which reduces the amount available for each pixel further down the line. This is fine in the beginning as each pixel has more than enough power to work with; a 5V pixel will work fine down to about 4V, for example. After a certain threshold (somewhere around 50 pixels), the pixel is unable to fully power all three LEDs, and thus they each have a lower brightness. There's a bunch of <a href="http://spikerlights.com/pwrinjection.aspx">charts and models</a> you can look at to get a richer understanding, but all you need to know is that this is a thing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Controller Port Limitations" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG 1264w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Credit: http://spikerlights.com/calcpower.aspx</figcaption></figure><p>So that's two limits: how many pixels a port can provide power to (83 or so) and how many pixels with good color rendering a port can drive (50 or so). Let's assume that neither of these is a problem. We'll just avoid physics and say that any number of pixels can be powered without melting the board, and further assume that voltage drop is not a thing. We <em>still</em> will have limits to how many pixels a single port can drive, but this time it's how many can be updated every frame.</p><p>"Frame" is an animation term, hearkening back to the French "framêz" which means I'm kidding I did literally zero research into the history of this terminology. I'm pretty sure it's from photography (a photograph is a frame contained by the borders of the photo) and then was adopted by movies, which are just 24 images per second being shown to you to give an illusion of moving pictures. In animation, particularly in computer animation, it's a moment which is frozen in time, where some controller or artist has defined exactly what the display should look like for that very brief moment.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/aladdin-genie-mouth-drop.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Controller Port Limitations"><figcaption>An example of a single frame</figcaption></figure><p>This is how pixel displays work. Many times per second, the controller tells every single pixel what color it should be, waits until the next update time, then tells every single pixel what color it should be again. Frame rate simply means "how many frames are shown over time" and is typically measured in frames per second. Refresh rate is directly related to this, but it typically describes how much time elapses between each refresh (frame) of the display and is typically measured in milliseconds or thousandths of a second. Common frame rates are 20fps and 40fps; the former has a refresh rate of 50ms and the latter has a refresh rate of 25ms.</p><p>Back to ports. Each port can only update a certain number of pixels in a given refresh rate time period; this is due to each pixel taking a tiny bit of time to take its portion of the message and pass the rest down the line, the speed of light (how fast the signal moves through the wires to the next pixel), and built-in overhead on the controller to determine what the next frame is going to look like. My controller (Falcon F16V3) can update 1024 pixels per port every frame, but only when running in 20fps; if I want 40fps, I have to drop my pixel count to around 600 pixels since the controller won't be able to keep up.</p><p>Fortunately, we can solve for two of these three main limitations. We can't do anything about the maximum number of pixels a single port can update; that's physics and computers and stuff, and it's pretty damn impressive that a controller can update 600 different tiny microcomputers (which is what LED pixels really are) across my front yard 40 times every single second. However, we <em>can </em>fix the much more restrictive limits of 50 pixels and 83 pixels by using power injection, and we'll get into that with the next post.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wiring Notes and Design Prep]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which I describe why writing down wiring details is helpful]]></description><link>https://glenmontlights.github.io/wiring-notes/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">613e541d60cdba0001ddbfee</guid><category><![CDATA[Christmas Lights]]></category><category><![CDATA[pixels]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Wickham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 20:04:45 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6077.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6077.jpg" alt="Wiring Notes and Design Prep"><p>One thing I've found very helpful when building props is to write down various notes about wiring. Sure, there are going to be some rules or guidelines you should follow (e.g. DC+ goes to DC+, how to manage power injection, etc), but what wire colors are, what connectors you use, whether the male plug is on the incoming side of the prop or on the outgoing, etc. are going to vary based upon your preferences, the types of components you buy, etc.</p><p>To add to the difficulty, sometimes this stuff is not very well documented. For example, for the pixel strands I bought there is no documentation as to whether the signal goes from the male plug to the female plug or vice versa; you have to figure it out on your own.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wiring Notes and Design Prep" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>What is all this?</figcaption></figure><p>Thus, writing these things down is incredibly helpful. By doing some preliminary thinking and design work, you can simplify the process of wiring and reduce the possibility of bad wiring quite a lot.</p><p>You won't have to go back and figure out what you've already done in order to try and match it. It's annoying to have to get a fully wired and functional prop out of storage to figure out which direction the current is flowing, which direction the plugs should go, etc. Further, if you always use the same practice for wiring things up, your system is more flexible and open to changes without having to rebuild connectors, etc.</p><p>At a minimum, these are the things I would write down:</p><ul><li>Which wire colors carry what type of current. Do this for pixel strands, other prewired props which need to be connected, signal cables running from the controllers to the props, and power injection.</li><li>What direction connectors face. I find it easiest to think of this as "incoming" and "outgoing", but it's also commonly referred to as "upstream" and "downstream" (controller/power source is always "outgoing" or "upstream"). As an example, if you buy the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32739097740.html?">Ray Wu connectors</a>, it's common to wire the female plug (holes instead of prongs) to the <a href="https://www.pixelcontroller.com/store/products/57-5mm-connectors.html">controller connectors</a> which plug into the board. The direction doesn't matter as long as it's consistent.</li><li>Which wires go to which connector poles. This is useful mainly for power injection wires, but it really depends on how in-depth you get with your wiring.</li></ul><p>That's seems like very little, but do each of these for each of the wire types and it starts getting to be a bit of info. However, I promise that you will appreciate having this when you go months between building props and have completely forgotten which way everything goes.</p><p>For me, it ended up looking something like this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wiring Notes and Design Prep" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Don't worry if you can't read my writing; I'm the only one who need to be able to 😂</figcaption></figure><p>As for that last bit about not connecting DC+ to signal cables?

One might want to do that if there are several groups of one type of model, then another group which has all of that model. I found an issue with how this works and am going to put a big caveat on using nested groups.</p><p>For example, on my house, I'm planning to have five stars on my garage and five stars on my house. I would like to be have the option to control them separate to each other, so I have "Stars - Garage" and "Stars - House". However, I also want to control all the stars together, so I want "Stars - All"; that way any time I add a star, I just add it to one group (say, "Stars - House") and anything group that has that group nested (say, "Stars - All" or "House - All") will automatically know about that new model.</p><p>However, this has a limitation during sequencing. When you apply effects, there is a "Render Style" option. In this, the default is to use all of the models in the group as a broad canvas onto which to apply the effect.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/grouped-2.gif" class="kg-image" alt="I Stand Corrected"><figcaption>Effect applied to a group, Default rendering</figcaption></figure><p>However, you also have the option to tell it to apply the effect to each of the models under the group (one such value is "Per Model Default"). This is useful when you want to have, say, the same starburst effect on all the stars without having all the stars on the timeline individually and applying the effect to all of them. I touched on the differences in the model grouping post. The end result is the same as if you'd applied the effects individually, but the same exact effect will be used and kept in sync.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/singles-2.gif" class="kg-image" alt="I Stand Corrected"><figcaption>Effect applied to a group, Per Model Default rendering</figcaption></figure><p>The limitation is this: if you have nested groups, the groups which are nested will be rendered as a group instead of the individual models. Here's an example using my "Stars - All" group (hey now, I'm an All Star...). For illustration purposes, I have both individual models and a nested group within this group so you can see the differences.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/high-level-group-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="I Stand Corrected"><figcaption>Effect applied to a group with individual models and a nested group, Default rendering</figcaption></figure><p>This is using the Default rendering on the top-level group. As you can see, the explosion goes out from the middle of the group and passes through all the stars. Let's see what happens when we change the Render Style to Per Model Default.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/per-model-default-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="I Stand Corrected"><figcaption>Effect applied to a group with individual models and a nested group, Per Model Default rendering</figcaption></figure><p>That's interesting, right? As you can see, each of the stars on the left bursts within the star itself, while on the right, the burst renders across all five stars. That's because the stars on the left are added to the group individually, whereas the stars on the right are added to the group within a nested group. </p><p>So we come to the crux: I am going to go back and, in <em>many</em> cases, change my groups to hold only models. In the long run, it is going to be a bit more maintenance as I add new models, but hopefully that'll be only like once or twice a year. However, with things on which I intend to never use Per Model Default rendering (e.g. my EVERYTHING group), I'll just keep with the nested groups, because damn are they convenient!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Starting a New Sequence]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which we prepare the canvas upon which we will create our work of art.]]></description><link>https://glenmontlights.github.io/dipping-your-toe-in-sequencing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">600bbd51300ac20001233424</guid><category><![CDATA[Christmas Lights]]></category><category><![CDATA[sequencing]]></category><category><![CDATA[xLights]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Wickham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 06:47:42 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/index.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/index.png" alt="Starting a New Sequence"><p>My last <a href="https://glenmontlights.github.io/philosophy-of-sequencing/">post about sequencing</a> went hard in the paint on the <em>why</em> but didn't really touch on the <em>how</em>. As you may recall, this blog is more of a record of what I did or am doing instead of a how-to. Thus, the lecture should be followed with lab work. So roll up your sleeves; we're gonna jump into sequencing!</p><p>First, choose a song. Any song will do, but it will be easier if it's a song with a regular beat that doesn't change tempo. I'm going with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW1dbiD_zDk"><em>Get the Party Started</em> by P!nk </a>. Feel free to question my taste, but I like this song.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-11.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting a New Sequence" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-11.png 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-11.png 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-11.png 1070w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Download the mp3 to your computer, and please do this legally, especially if it's a holiday song. I'll have another post about directory organization soon, but really quick, inside my xlights directory, I have a directory called "songs" and, within that, a separate directory for each of the songs that I am sequencing; I put the song, videos, and save the sequences there. This may not be best practice; we'll find out later though, and it seems to work so far.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting a New Sequence"></figure><p>To create a new sequence, open xLights, navigate to the Sequencer tab, and click "New Sequence".  It's the yellow page lookin' icon in the upper left. You can also find it in the "File" menu, or using the keyboard shortcut <code>ctrl+n</code> (probably <code>cmd+n</code> on Mac, but I haven't installed xLights on my Mac yet);</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting a New Sequence" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-14.png 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-14.png 601w"></figure><p>First thing you'll get is a dialog asking if you want a "Musical Sequence" or an "Animation". The latter is just pretty light patterns which aren't set to music; you can totally do a show using this, use animations between sets, on holidays where there aren't as many songs, if you have only a few lights, etc. For this, we'll be syncing with music, so choose the "Musical Sequence" option. (Note; there are other tabs on this dialog; we're ignoring them as you don't need to play with them) You will be prompted to select a song; find the one you downloaded and open it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-15.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting a New Sequence"></figure><p>Now you'll be asked to select either 40fps or 20fps for the framerate (the millisecond number in parenthesis are how many milliseconds each frame is allotted). Well, you can define the fps manually using the "Custom" button, but 40 and 20 are fine values; I wouldn't use Custom unless you have a reason.</p><p>40fps will give you smoother gradations and transitions between colors, along with being able to more closely time effects with the beat in the song. However, it comes at the cost of file sizes which are twice as large which can be a bad thing. From what I've heard, 20fps is a fine option unless you know that your hardware (pixel controllers, animation player, network gear) can handle the larger file sizes. One example is that, if you choose to use 40fps, you have a limit of 680 pixels per port on the Falcon controllers, as opposed to the <em>possible</em> 1024 which each port can handle at 20fps. I've spent many days (over a week?) diving into this and planning accordingly, so I'm choosing 40fps.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-16.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting a New Sequence" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-16.png 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-16.png 604w"></figure><p>Finally, you are prompted to select which models you want included from the start, then you can either "Quick Start" or go through "More Options". For the models, you can always manage which models are visible/controllable in the sequencer after the fact; I generally choose to start with empty because it's easier to add a dozen or two groups/models than to remove three or four dozen models I'm not going to use individually.</p><p>I genuinely have no idea what is under "More Options" </p><p>... clicks through</p><p>Hmmm, import sequences from other programs (or xLights), edit the metadata, import timings. All stuff we're not going to super worry about for this sequence. Cool, so just click the "Quick Start" button.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-17.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting a New Sequence" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-17.png 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-17.png 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/image-17.png 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/09/image-17.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>One brand new sequence</figcaption></figure><p>Okay! Now we do something which everyone online says to do: as soon as you open a sequence, save it right away; the reaosn they say this is saving kicks off a rendering pass. It will do nothing in this case but save the sequence; however, it's good to have something to quick save to; thus save it (I save it right next to the music file in my <code>songs</code> directory).</p><p>Awesome, now we have a blank slate!</p><p>Coming up in the next few posts, we'll get into managing the models which we are going to control in the sequencing pane, set up timing tracks to better syncronize and lay out our effects, then start putting down some effects.

I'll mention some things which other people say they have done, but I can't vouch for them, though they do sound reasonable.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-8.png" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-8.png 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-8.png 606w"></figure><p>Caveat 2: I'm not endorsing or sponsored by any of the vendors I'm linking to here. In fact, were it not for my desire to give credit where it's due, I probably wouldn't include links, just steal the pictures. I may or may not be using the products I share below; I don't know. I haven't gotten that far.</p><p>First thing to do is to decide how many pixels. On the rooflines and straight runs, I opted to do a 2" spacing which, judging by my existing attempt at pixel lighting, is fine. It's not excellent, but it's fine. When installing, I'm planning on using some mounting material which will allow me to go to 1" spacing if I desire, but that sounds a bit like overkill to me. A couple of examples are below. After I did all the calculations, I determined I'd need 2,116 pixels for the outlines.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!"><figcaption>Chromatrim, semi-rigid mounting at 1" spacing in 4' strips (<a href="https://boscoyostudio.com/product/chromatrim/">Boscoyo</a>)</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-7.png" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-7.png 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-7.png 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/image-7.png 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-7.png 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>megatree roll, 1" spacing, flexible so you can just roll up the lights after the season (<a href="https://boscoyostudio.com/product/megatree-mounting-strip-heavy-duty-max-roll-200/">Boscoyo</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>I also used some retail props (the stars, arches, and spinners) to estimate the number of pixels for each of those. Of course, this is going to vary from place to place and what you want in yours, so do a bit of research (google "holiday coro", "christmas light rgb props" and the like), find some you want, and look at the pixel count (in quite a few cases, the vendor has custom models for xLights; there will be a future post about that). The props ended up taking 2,788 pixels.</p><p>Finally, there was the megatree. These are somewhat easy to calculate as long as you know how dense you want it. I want more of a beginner's megatree (well, I <em>want</em> a huge one, but I'm starting with a smaller one to see how it goes), so I'm allocating about 800 pixels for that (50 per string, 16 strings around the tree; this is a fairly common configuration).</p><p>Grand total: 5,704 pixels in my xLights configuration.</p><p>Now that I'd decided on a number, I started reading the forums (mainly <a href="https://www.auschristmaslighting.com">auschristmaslighting.com</a>, even though I'm not in Australia; it's incredibly useful) and found that the three most common vendors are eBay, Amazon, and Aliexpress. Amazon is reliable and fast, but relatively expensive. Aliexpress is reliable and relatively inexpensive, but can be slower, eBay can be quite a bit cheaper, but you're sacrificing the reliability. I opted for Aliexpress.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-9.png 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-9.png 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-9.png 1589w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now, on that forum, when it comes to purchases, <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/store/701799?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.593e4c15fD6DfX">Ray Wu's store</a> will come up a lot. This is a highly used vendor in this hobby and they have a ton of supplies for pretty great prices. However, I wanted to see what else was available because Aliexpress is HUGE (plus roughly 30% of the cost would have been shipping, and being a Prime member for years, I've developed an allergy to paying for shipping).</p><p>I ended up buying from another vendor because I was able to get 1,000 pixel lots pretty inexpensively. I <em>did</em> find one vendor with free shipping, but paying for shipping ended up being cheaper when I bought the lots. A note on this a bit later. Any rate, the 6,000 lights were around $950, which is $0.16 per pixel; I understand that to be reasonable, though I have heard of others getting them for about half that. I placed my order on the 30th of Dec, and I received the first of two boxes today, Jan. 6 (I have a tracking number for the other box and it should be here soon). Not bad!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/09/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>ten 500 pixel bags</figcaption></figure><p>Oh, I totally didn't talk about voltage in this post. I should have. I will in the next post.</p><p>So, I'm happy with my pixels and can't wait to get a controller and some power supplies so I can start turning them on and stuff. I'm still trying to figure out what exactly to do for props and mounting, so that will have to come later. Full update when it happens, though.</p><p>Any rate, two things which came up as credible options. First off, apparently you can contact vendors on Aliexpress (Ray's name was brought up for this) and ask for a quote for the number of pixels you want. From what I understand (I heard this after I placed my order, so I didn't get an opportunity to find out, though I will probably purchase another thousand, or two so I may try then), he will often reduce or waive the shipping fee.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-10.png" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-10.png 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-10.png 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-10.png 1116w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Shipping cost ain't no joke; $16 for a $5 item.</figcaption></figure><p>Since in my case, shipping would have been around $300, that savings is nothing to sniff at.</p><p>Second credible option I've heard: group buys. If you are getting into the hobby, I would suggest finding a forum (or forums) to join, then seek out folks in your area. There are (were; thanks COVID) meetups all over the world at least a couple times a year, and there can be vendors at these meetups, instructional sessions, demos, etc. But one other thing which is not uncommon is arranging group buys in order to get large bulk discounts; if 10 (or 50) people pool their orders and go through one vendor, they're likely to get a savings on cost and on shipping; then the items are distributed at the meetup.</p><p>Any rate, that's the cut and dry of how I got my pixels. Next time, I'll go into pixel voltage and how to decide what strands will work for you.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Philosophy of Sequencing]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which we wax philosophical about why we should spend hours creating an intricate sequence]]></description><link>https://glenmontlights.github.io/philosophy-of-sequencing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ff347d5300ac20001233299</guid><category><![CDATA[Christmas Lights]]></category><category><![CDATA[xLights]]></category><category><![CDATA[sequencing]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Wickham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 05:21:46 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-1-1024x567.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-1-1024x567.png" alt="The Philosophy of Sequencing"><p>Pull up a cup of your favorite beverage and get cozy with the sequencing tab, because as far as I can tell (with my ~2 weeks experience in the hobby) this is where you're likely to spend most of your time.</p><p>At a very basic level, sequencing is the act of making the lights you've defined change color and/or brightness in a pleasing pattern. This is probably what attracted you to the hobby in the first place; sure all that wiring of props and building of controllers is impressive, but at the end of the day, those aren't super impressive without the blinky flashy.</p><p>One thing to note: sequencing is an art form, and I'm not just speaking metaphorically. As a sequencer, you are taking a certain medium (usually music) and an instrument (thousands of lights which can turn colors on demand), and enhancing the experience in some way. Different people can take the same layout and same song and come up with completely different shows, each highlighting some aspect of the artist.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Philosophy of Sequencing" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-2.png 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-2.png 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/image-2.png 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-2.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>One helluva sequence! credit: smeighan, auschristmaslighting.com</figcaption></figure><p>Another thing to note: sequencing takes <em>LOTS</em> of time and <em>LOTS</em> of practice. Just as with any art form, as you learn how to control the instrument, you will find new ways to express yourself. What may have been a simple color wash when you first started out may morph into a ripple effect on top of a video of the certain color with some sparkles thrown in. Experimentation with the various tools will lead to experience, but experimentation (and experience) takes time. There are ways around that, which I'll touch on near the end.</p><p>So, what eats the time? "I'm only doing a show for a four minute song; how long could it take?" Of course, this answer varies. On the pragmatic side, it will take as much time as you give it. Using <a href="https://glenmontlights.github.io/model-grouping/">model grouping</a>, and timing tracks (which I'll cover later; tldr they highlight the beats/measures/bars/notes of a song), it's not impossible to have a show sequenced for a song within ten minutes. However, this display is going to be very broad strokes; think doing a paint-by-number with a roller. This will <em>work</em>, and if you have a lot of lights, it may be <em>impressive</em>, but it won't necessarily be <em>good</em> or <em>remarkable</em>.</p><p>For a well-designed, good show you'll have to get into details, and adding details is going to take time. Going back to the paint-by-numbers analogy, we started with the "just use a paint roller" analogy. To get into the details, we start using finer and finer brushes. Maybe your first stab is like slopping patches of paint where they're supposed to go, but the picture is more recognizable than the starting state. Spend more time with a small brush, pay attention to the lines, and the picture is fully realized. Go even further, adding details which weren't specifically called for, and the painting starts coming alive.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Philosophy of Sequencing" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-1.png 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-1.png 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>credit: ListenToOurLights.com</figcaption></figure><p>The same concept applies to sequencing. It's really simple and fast to make all the lights flash patterns in time with the music; there's even a function in xLights which will just fill in a sequence for you. However, if you want the various elements to do different things, in sync with other elements, but complementing each other while using a pleasing color palette, changing that palette in order to emphasize the mood of the music... well, that will take some doing. There's a lot of fiddling with various different effects to make them just right, to have them hit the timing marks perfectly, to get just the right color combinations. The challenge comes in trying to not get <em>too</em> perfect, which is basically impossible.</p><p>However, the payoff is when you get everything together and it looks <em>amazing</em>. Put aside the little errors that you find, because every artist is their own worst critic. This is a very uncommon art form, and it is going to wow people, regardless of how perfect (or not) the show is. Enjoy the final result, the fruits of your labor, and come up with ideas for your next sequence, the next song. After all, there's always next year!</p><p>At the end of the day, if you get 100 people looking at your light show, a very small handful are going to want to look at, or even be capable of appreciating, the symmetrical way in which you spliced all the wires, the fact that you were able to save at least three solder points on each of the stars because of the clever way you did the power injection, etc. However <em>everyone</em> will be able to see, and came by to see, the show; the lights turning colors, fading in and out, turning on and off, in sync with music, they will enjoy it, and you will make their lives a bit better.</p><p>They want the same as you: the blinky flashy.</p><p>With the next post, we'll go back to our regularly scheduled programming, not this philosophy crap. I promise.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Model Grouping Basics]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which we explore the benefits of grouping models together]]></description><link>https://glenmontlights.github.io/model-grouping/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ff0a61a300ac200012331b5</guid><category><![CDATA[xLights]]></category><category><![CDATA[Christmas Lights]]></category><category><![CDATA[model]]></category><category><![CDATA[Layout]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Wickham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 17:51:52 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-095256.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-095256.jpg" alt="Model Grouping Basics"><p>In one of my <a href="https://glenmontlights.github.io/putting-up-the-lights/">previous posts</a>, I briefly mentioned groups when discussing building the models of lights. I wanted to go a bit deeper on this topic now because I think this is a super amazing thing for people who are lazy like I am.</p><p>First off, what is grouping? At a high level, the name is right there on the tin: you are <em>grouping</em> your models together with the intention of using them as a single model. Let me give you a simple example.</p><p>I'm going to apply a simple Butterfly effect to the stars on my roof in two different modes: individually, and as a group. First, let's see what this effect looks like when we put it on the individual models.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/singles-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Model Grouping Basics"></figure><p>You get the same effect copied to each of the stars. Makes sense, right?</p><p>Now, let's see what it looks like if we group the models and then apply the effect to the group.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/grouped-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Model Grouping Basics"></figure><p>Much different, right? The effect has exactly the same settings in both cases, it's just been applied to different models.</p><p>Why would I want to do this? Well, when you apply an effect to a group, it has a more cohesive impact on the display. If you don't want to do a great deal of manual manipulation, using groups can drastically cut the complexity (and amount of time) of a sequence. Also, quite often you want all of a type of model to do the same thing at the same time. A very simple example of this would be to have all the stars blinking on the beat.</p><p>Now that we've covered the high-level what and why, let's get into the how. Open up xLights and go to the Layout tab. I'm assuming that you've added some models already, but if you haven't, you can go through some of my previous posts to get basic info on how to do this.</p><p>I'm going to show you how I put the stars above into a group. First, I highlight the models in the model list on the left. It doesn't matter what order you select them in as everything ends up alphabetical anyway, and you can move things around in the sequencer when we get there.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-092432.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Model Grouping Basics" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-092432.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-092432.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-092432.jpg 1227w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>I obviously get points for excellent naming, especially since they're not in order :-). The stars are numbered, left to right, 9, 8, 7, 6, 10</figcaption></figure><p>Right clicking on the selected models will bring up a context menu; since we're creating a new group, we'll choose "Create Group from Selections". If you're adding to a group, then you can use "Add Selections to Existing Group", but I'm not so we're not.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-092709.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Model Grouping Basics" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-092709.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-092709.jpg 638w"></figure><p>It'll ask you to enter a name for your group; you can put whatever you want, as long as it doesn't conflict with the name of an existing group or model.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-092924.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Model Grouping Basics"></figure><p>And now you have a new group! I named mine "House Stars" because I'm creative like that. By default, groups will be at the top of the model list, before any individual models. Also, by default the model list is in alphabetical order, so it'll go A-Z groups, then A-Z models. Keep this in mind if you want to have certain models or groups easily accessible; I've seen people keep commonly-accessed ones at the top by using numbers instead of letters.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-093303.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Model Grouping Basics"></figure><p>If you click on the arrow/carat icon to the left of the group name, it will expand and show all the models within. You may have noticed that on my stars, there is a carat on the models themselves; these are custom models which have models inside of them. We'll get into that a bit more in the next couple of posts.</p><p>If you select the group name, the info panel will have a whole host of new options and selections; I've only just started scratching the surface of this stuff, but the tl;dr is that you can tell the group how to behave as a model.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-01-02-093741.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Model Grouping Basics"></figure><p>The default is to do the behavior I highlighted above; make it seem as if an effect is using all of the models as a single model. However, if you wanted to retain the individual model behavior (say, have a starbust on each model) but not have to apply the same effect to each model individually, you can control that here.</p><p>Another interesting thing about grouping is that you can add groups to groups. Coming from a software engineering background, I never like to do the same thing twice. Say I add a new star to my roof stars. Also assume I have several groups which contain my roof stars: Roof Stars, Stars, and Everything (all real groups in my setup). If I make up each of these groups with individual models, I have to remember to add the new star to each of those groups, and I guarantee I will forget to do that.</p><p>Enter nested groups. Just as you added models by selecting them, right clicking, and either creating or adding to a group, you can do the same things with groups. By doing this, you can easily build up groups which are automatically updated as you add models to the subgroups contained within.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Model Grouping Basics"></figure><p>If I add a Star11 to House Stars, any effect I have on House Stars, Stars, or EVERYTHING will start incorporating the new element the next time I render; same with any other groups I may have which include House Stars.</p><p>To summarize, combining models into groups can make your sequences far less complex, give you a quick route to an impressive display, and provide automatic updating capabilities. Thus, using groups is a very powerful tool and allows you to build more and more impressive sequences, removing much of the frustration you may experience using individual models.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Save Your Work!]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which we highlight the importance of saving.]]></description><link>https://glenmontlights.github.io/save-your-work/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5fed1e9e300ac200012331a6</guid><category><![CDATA[xLights]]></category><category><![CDATA[Christmas Lights]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Wickham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:45:04 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-164402-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-164402-1.jpg" alt="Save Your Work!"><p>I didn't mention the most important button in the Layout section: the Save button.

If developers of xLights stumble across this post, I am very sorry; I have an incredible amount of respect for the work that you did with this as a labor of love, but this just does not agree with me at all. Also, I'm perfectly willing to admit that it may just be me.</p><p>All that said, lemme break it down.</p><p>Since I don't have any idea how I'm going to control this display yet, I'm still getting an idea of how much stuff I want to get, and I just kinda want to see some shiny stuff, I'm starting with the "Layout" section in xLights.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Putting Up the Lights" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214.jpg 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214.jpg 2024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Looks like this</figcaption></figure><p>On the left on the top, you have a list of all the models which exist in the layout, with the groups on top (I'll get into groups later; they're pretty neat). Below that is the properties panel for whichever model/group is highlighted. There are only a handful of fields which I've touched in the lower part of the panel, so I'm not incredibly familiar with what everything does, but it seems pretty easy to use.</p><p>You also have two tabs: one for "Models", and one for "3D Objects". The only things on the latter tab are the house and the grid. I haven't seen anything which indicates I need to put more on there, so I'll just ignore it for now.</p><p>On the right, is the display with all the models you have. As an example, in the above image, the white lines at the edges of my roof are models of strands of lights. if you highlight them, they turn bright yellow so you can see which thing is selected.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-153649-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Putting Up the Lights" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-153649-1.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-153649-1.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-153649-1.jpg 1228w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>After a few more models, and this time with everything selected</figcaption></figure><p>Controlling the view is a bit interesting. Holding down the left click button and moving the mouse will rotate around the center of the screen. Scroll wheel on the mouse will zoom; clicking and holding the scroll wheel (or middle mouse button; on mine that's the same thing) will pan the camera without rotating. <em>However</em>, I will add that this works <em>most</em> of the time; sometimes it seems that the view gets confused so doing the above actions no longer works as expected. Fortunately, there is a command which will fix that. If you right-click, you get the option to "Reset" your view; this works wonders.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-154249.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Putting Up the Lights" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-154249.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-154249.jpg 654w"></figure><p>To create a new model, select one from the list of models above the layout view (the one which has icons for arches, candy canes, etc).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-154418.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Putting Up the Lights" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-154418.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-154418.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-154418.jpg 1016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>After that, you click and drag the model onto the view.

In order to do that, let's take a closer look at the model.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="Putting Up the Lights" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-3.png 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-3.png 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-3.png 1332w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>No particular reason I chose an arch beyond "it's the first one", but it has enough info. There are two separate concepts to take in here.</p><p>First, there's the different colored cubes. The orange one is the main anchor point and is roughly in the center of the model. The green one and the blue one opposite are the start and end of the line, respectively; you mainly use these when connecting the models to controllers to tell them where the first and last pixels in the model are so it doesn't get rendered backwards.</p><p>Second, there's the different colored arrows coming out of the orange cube in the model above. Those are your controls and how you manipulate the model. In the picture above, the orange cube has arrows coming out of it, one color for each of the three axes in 3D space. If you grab the green arrow, for instance, you'll be moving the model up and down.</p><p>You can change which cube you're manipulating by clicking on any of the other cubes (the cube above the orange is unique to arches, so ignore it for now). So if you click on the green cube, the arrows will be coming out of it and you can then move the green cube while the blue cube opposite stays in place.</p><p>Clicking multiple times on the cubes will display different manipulation tools. The triangular arrows move the model, square arrows scale the model (make it bigger or smaller), and square arrows with circular guides rotate the model.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-162442.jpg" width="311" height="256" alt="Putting Up the Lights"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-162454.jpg" width="360" height="305" alt="Putting Up the Lights"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-30-162503.jpg" width="393" height="294" alt="Putting Up the Lights"></div></div></div><figcaption>From left to right, move, scale, rotate</figcaption></figure><p>The idea here is to use these tools to move the model you've created into its intended place. Since nothing snaps to any edges, this involves a lot of rotating the view to see from different perspectives, tweaking here and there, etc. But, as I mentioned in the <a href="https://glenmontlights.github.io/here-we-go-a-modeling/">last post</a>, you don't need it to be perfect; this is just a model by which you can get an idea of what it looks like. This program has been around for years without a 3D modeling view, so you'll be <em>fine</em> if stuff is a bit off, as long as it looks basically correct from the intended viewing angle.</p><p>Then, it's just rinse and repeat as many times as you have models. I ended up with 66 models for my house; that feels like a lot, but I used straight lines instead of, say, polylines for all the roofline and stuff, so there's probably some improvements I could make.</p><p>In the next post, I'll get into the properties section for the models, where you can do things like change the number of lights, rename them, do some modifications with the controllers, etc.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Here We Go a Modeling...]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which we spend way too much time building a 3D model of the house]]></description><link>https://glenmontlights.github.io/here-we-go-a-modeling/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5feb89c9300ac2000123304a</guid><category><![CDATA[Christmas Lights]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sketchup]]></category><category><![CDATA[xLights]]></category><category><![CDATA[3d model]]></category><category><![CDATA[3d]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Wickham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 02:47:18 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214-1.jpg" alt="Here We Go a Modeling..."><p>In recent versions, xLights has added the capability to import a 3D model of your house in order to get a better view of what the resultant display will look like. This is all well and good, but now you have to <em>build the model.</em> This is easier said than done, and it doesn't sound easy. Fortunately, I've been using <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/">Sketchup </a>for years, so I figured what the hell, I'll give it a shot.</p><p>I'm not going to tell you how to build a 3D model in Sketchup. That's not this kind of blog, I have other things to do this month, etc. However, I'll give two pointers which helped me out a lot.</p><p>First: do some measuring. Get lots of measurements. Get more measurements. I promise you will likely miss some dimension and then have to go back and measure it again. When I measured, I got all the places where I figured I'd be putting lights, plus how high they were off the ground, how far away they were from other places on my house, etc. This took me some time and a bit of climbing on the roof, but it was well worth the effort.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/measuring_tape.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Here We Go a Modeling..."><figcaption>Don't be this guy though</figcaption></figure><p>Second: don't go too crazy on the detail. I know that sounds like it goes against what I said above. Just keep in mind that, while you want this to look proportional, this model is only ever going to be used in xLights; your audience won't see it. Therefore, if the model isn't <em>exactly</em> square or if the walls are an inch shorter, you are the only one who will know. This model is an approximate representation of what the lights will end up looking like.</p><p>Armed with measurements, I fired up Sketchup and built a model. It looks fine. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182138.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Here We Go a Modeling..." srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182138.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182138.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182138.jpg 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182138.jpg 1713w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Then came the hard part: how to get it from Sketchup into xLights.</p><p>The main issue is that xLights only imports one format: .obj. And, of course, that's not one that Sketchup exports to. Well, not natively. Well, not natively in the free version, and since the paid version is a LOT of money, I'd rather find a way around it.</p><p>Some googling led me to a series of plugins which will export to .obj for me. Great! Installed the first one I tried (LIPID Obj exporter), got an .obj file, copied it to my xLights show directory, then imported it using the "Add Obj" button.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182649.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Here We Go a Modeling..." srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182649.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182649.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182649.jpg 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182649.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Uhhhh, this is hot garbage. So, turns out that there are quite a few things this plugin doesn't do, one of which is rotate the model. Fine, I can manually rotate. But still, there are no textures; it's just a grey blob. I can do better.</p><p>Enter QuadFace Tools. This is a series of plugins (if I recall correctly, it is a paid program with a trial period), one of which does .obj export. Fine. Install <em>that</em>, run the plugin, get an .obj file, move that to my xLights directory, and try again. Now I have an option to swap the y axis, and to export textures. Hmmm, those both sound promising.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182649-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Here We Go a Modeling..." srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182649-1.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182649-1.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182649-1.jpg 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-182649-1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Same shit, but now I've wasted 45 minutes.</p><p>Okay. So, I <em><em>also</em></em> hear that you can use <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> to export .obj and that Blender reads .dae files which Sketchup exports. Hmmmm... never used Blender, but I've also never used xLights before today, so here goes. Download Blender, install, export from Sketchup, import into Blender.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-183644.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Here We Go a Modeling..." srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-183644.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-183644.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-183644.jpg 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-183644.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Ummm, all my walls are in one place, but everything else is where it should be. Plus, I have no idea how to move things around.

I will open my Sketchup file there, export the .obj, and never open the pro version again.</p><p>Except, apparently, there is an art to how the textures are applied. First off, I was using both colors and textures in the model; colors for the paint, textures for the other stuff. Turns out, when I import into xLights, it doesn't understand the colors and needs a texture file. So, I go and turn the colors into texture files, reapply them in Sketchup, and export <em>again</em>. But this time, the textures were applied to components which had groups nested within them, so the texure didn't work. So I had to go, explode all my nested components, reapply textures, re-export them, and import into xLights. But hey, success!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Here We Go a Modeling..." srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214-2.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214-2.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214-2.jpg 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2020-12-29-184214-2.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This is how it looks after I've added a bunch of models to the house (lights on the edges, mostly), which I'll get into a bit more in a later post. But for now, building a model and importing into xLights is complete, and it only took me a GREAT deal of frustration and about a dozen hours (two hours maybe to build the model, at least ten hours to get a good model in xLights).</p><p>Yeah, remember rule 2? I sooooooo could have been done after rotating the first import; it was functionally usable.</p><p>Hell, I don't even really <em>need</em> to use 3D since I later found that all the effects are rendered in 2D anyway.

Of course, I can never have anything be that easy for me, so I used that as a starting point, doing searches for Light-O-Rama alternates. Of course, there are <em>plenty</em> of alternates, both on the hardware and software side of things.</p><p>Since I have no interest in building out the same display more than once to determine what is the best, I've opted to just pick technologies which seem to have the most mentions, support, resources, etc. I know kinda what I'm looking for in terms of the physical, viewable display, so I only have to figure out the exact types of lights, how to power them, how to control them, and how to program them. Daunting decisions, since there is usually no <em>right</em> answer, just optimizations for various things which I don't know yet!</p><p>Since I have the end result pretty well in mind, I figured I'd start with the actual show sequencing itself. I have a bunch of reasons for doing this, but a good portion of the decision making comes down to price. This is an <em>expensive</em> hobby (I'm a LEGO collector; I know expensive) and I'd like to be able to spread the financial impact out a little.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/d023hS.gif" class="kg-image" alt="My First Steps"><figcaption>Pictured: not me</figcaption></figure><p>Thus I'm starting with what I want the display to look like. This will also help me determine how much I can trim it and still have it look good (in software terms, how can I get it to an MVP or a v1). Doing so will allow me to identify components which make sense to incrementally add on (e.g. pixels, power, props, etc) as opposed to purchasing larger with expansion in mind (e.g. controllers).</p><p>Enter the sequencer. There are quite a few out there, but after ~1 week of Googling, I believe the biggest three are Light-O-Rama's <a href="http://www1.lightorama.com/showtime-sequencing-suite/">Showtime Suite</a>, <a href="http://www.vixenlights.com/">Vixen</a>, and <a href="http://www.xlights.org/">xLights</a>. Of course, that's cheating since Showtime Suite pretty well locks you into LOR and I'm not going that route, so I had to choose between Vixen and xLights, both of which are free.</p><p>I've chosen xLights, mainly because it seems to have better support and a richer feature set, admittedly at a potential cost of ease of use. A couple things I really like about it (not sure how <em>useful</em> they are, but we'll see) are the animation mode where I don't have to sync it to music, and the 3D preview for my house which, given the way I'm imagining my layout, will make things easier to visualize. Hopefully.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/maxresdefault-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="My First Steps" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/maxresdefault-1.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/maxresdefault-1.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/maxresdefault-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Not my house, but this is the 3d model view in xLights</figcaption></figure><p>Note that I have never used either Vixen or Showtime Suite, and I don't intend to unless I become completely frustrated with xLights, so any comparisons have a strong potential to be invalid due to ignorance. That's what you get when you read a post by someone who's not a professional Christmas light programmer review person.</p><p>Any rate, that's my next step: get xLights, set up the display in my mind, add a sequence to it, then see what phases make sense. After that, I can find out what I need to purchase and start making orders. Fortunately, it's Dec. 28, so I have roughly 11 months to get this all sorted!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Diving into Fancy Christmas Light Displays]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which we discuss the intentions for this site]]></description><link>https://glenmontlights.github.io/diving-into-christmas-lights/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5fea3f70300ac20001232e92</guid><category><![CDATA[Christmas Lights]]></category><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Wickham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 21:03:49 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/bd922c87d40a4f4f0a93c7bd172c1bec.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/bd922c87d40a4f4f0a93c7bd172c1bec.jpg" alt="Diving into Fancy Christmas Light Displays"><p>In 2018, I had an idea: I'd build a string of lights that I could program to do awesome things. I was inspired by my neighbor who'd bought a set of LEDs which changed color and all worked together to do some cool things, but that was <em>store bought</em>, thus not challenging enough for me.</p><p>I wanted mine to do <em>fancy</em> things. <em>Awesome</em> things.</p><p>So, I jumped right into it and bought a 10-pack of WS2811 12V 50-pixel strands.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/bd922c87d40a4f4f0a93c7bd172c1bec-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Diving into Fancy Christmas Light Displays" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/bd922c87d40a4f4f0a93c7bd172c1bec-1.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/bd922c87d40a4f4f0a93c7bd172c1bec-1.jpg 640w"></figure><p>Turns out I had no idea what to do next. As a result, I kinda thrashed for a while, making a bunch of false starts. I ended up picking up an Arduino Uno, installed FastLED on it, and manually programmed a bunch of effects. Pretty cool, but very limited; I had to recompile and install every time I wanted to change anything.</p><p>For power, I purchased a 12V power supply, learned about voltage drop and power injection, and now I could power and control a strand long enough to go across the front of my house.</p><p>For mounting, I ended up getting 2" PVC, using the table saw to cut a channel in the back, used my drill press to drill 279 1/2" holes spaced at 2", popped pixels into the pipe, ran power wire, and hung them on the gutters or used pipe clamps on the fascia boards.</p><p>And thus, the fully programmable LED strand was born!</p><p>Since that time, I've done a few improvements, mostly on the software, but I also revamped the controller. I now have a box containing the power supply, the ESP8266 board I graduated in to, and a few different odds and ends to make it work.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/IMG_4393.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Diving into Fancy Christmas Light Displays" srcset="https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/IMG_4393.jpg 600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/IMG_4393.jpg 1000w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/IMG_4393.jpg 1600w, https://glenmontlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/IMG_4393.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Top left: ESP2866 board with level shifter and fancy data outputs for 4 channels. Top Right: voltage converter (12V power supply and lights, 5V processor). Bottom: power supply</figcaption></figure><p>I also upgraded the software so now I can control the lights via MQTT, chosen because I'm a big home assistant user and am familiar with MQTT.</p><p>Still though, I don't have all sorts of cool effects, and even if I did, the color correctness of the lights is going away, and there is only one string of lights. If I want fancy, I'm going to have to add on. And, if I'm gonna get fancy, I might as well make it possible to sync to music as well.</p><p>And so I'm starting down the rabbit hole of huge light displays. And, since some of the answers I'm looking for don't seem to be readily available online, I'm also documenting my process, both so I can go back and remind myself what I did at midnight two weeks ago, and so there may be more public information on how to do the things.</p><p>The blog will have two main functions: the blog itself will provide a kind of event log, going step by step through what I'm doing. There may be a bunch of wrong turns, and I may completely invalidate things by what I do later. I'll try to go back and update old posts to point to real information, but sometimes I won't. I'm lazy, I know it, and I'm not apologizing. In blog parlance, this is the "posts" section.</p><p>The second section will be more of a wiki: this should contain the latest, correctest information, and as close to a representation of my display's current state as is reasonable. Again, using blog parlance, this is the "pages" section.</p><p>So, without further ado, here goes nothin.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
