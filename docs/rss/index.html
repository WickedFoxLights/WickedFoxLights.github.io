It&apos;s a bit of a bummer that this has to be done so soon after designing the last display, but an evolving display was always in the cards, so that evolution is just going to be a bit more... aggressive this year!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2022/05/evolution.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Permanent Roofline Lights" loading="lazy" width="600" height="452" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2022/05/evolution.jpg 600w"><figcaption>like this, only... less so. credit: <a href="http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/webproj/212_spring_2017/Andrew_Adler/Physics_of_Pokemon/evolution.html">The Physics of Pokemon</a></figcaption></figure><p>However, first things first. We really enjoyed having the &quot;permanent&quot; lights up on the roofline for the previous several years, so we want to have that again. Perhaps something a bit more... polished? Something that looks a bit more like it&apos;s meant to be permanent? I <em>guess</em> there&apos;s nothing wrong with just draping 2&quot; PVC pipe over the gutter, but we have EXPERIENCE now; we can do better than that! </p><p>I&apos;ve been reading a bunch about various different methods of installing permanent lights on the roofline, so lots of different thoughts and approaches. However, three are really worth considering, in my opinion.</p><p>First, one clarification. I say &quot;roofline&quot;, but I want something that looks a bit more polished and is generally kinda hidden and out of the way. At the last place, the white PVC blended well enough with the white gutters and trim, but you could still see all the pixels and, while it wasn&apos;t <em>bad</em>, we can do better.</p><p>Thus, the goal is to install the lights on the inside of the fascia with the lights facing downward, just peeking out past the fascia. Note that we don&apos;t have soffits, so the rear of the fascia is totally open. By installing this way, when the lights aren&apos;t on, they&apos;re almost invisible. This mounting also has a couple side benefits, the biggest one being that the lights are out of the elements; they won&apos;t be rained on, will be somewhat protected from the wind, and won&apos;t get direct sunlight.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2022/05/fascia-board-01.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Permanent Roofline Lights" loading="lazy" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/fascia-board-01.jpg 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2022/05/fascia-board-01.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>but flush with the bottom</figcaption></figure><p>So, let&apos;s talk about installation methods. As mentioned, there are four opions, and we&apos;ll go through them each.</p><p>First, there&apos;s LED strips with aluminum channels and diffusers. These generally look really good and polished since they are intended to be more visible. Also, due to the higher pixel density (sometimes much higher) animations and transitions look smoother, an effect which is enhanced by the diffuser. However, there are some things I don&apos;t like about them. First, power injection is a bit harder. It&apos;s not <em>hard</em>, but it requires soldering and stripping back some weatherproofing, then adding hot glue and heat shrink to make it weatherproof again. Second they&apos;re harder to repair; replacing a single pixel in a string is easy; in a strip, it&apos;s hard. Third, I haven&apos;t had much luck with the adhesive in them, so they could end up flopping around in the channel. Finally, not much room to run power injection wire in the channel to begin with.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2022/05/led-strip.webp" class="kg-image" alt="Permanent Roofline Lights" loading="lazy" width="1413" height="667" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/led-strip.webp 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/led-strip.webp 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2022/05/led-strip.webp 1413w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>credit: <a href="https://www.derunledlights.com/complete-guide-permanent-install-led-strip-christmas-lights/">Derun LED Lights</a></figcaption></figure><p>Since strips themselves don&apos;t seem to be great, let&apos;s look at LED bullets. Using bullets (pixels, whatever) is familiar to me, and I know how to handle them, so that&apos;s a plus. Also... I have a <em>bunch</em>, so I don&apos;t have to buy more, which is a <em>huge</em> plus. Therefore, the next three options will use pixels.</p><p>Option 2 is using LED bullets with Permatrack. Permatrack is a purpose-built product for mounting these bullets to a house permanently. It seems to be simple to mount, has a channel for running wires, and - importantly - has predrilled holes for the pixels at a good spacing. They also look <em>fantastic</em>. This would provide less time from purchase to installation because I wouldn&apos;t have to build a jig and drill several hundred holes, and <em>could</em> be easier to install. However, this is the most expensive bullet mounting option, coming in around $4 per foot before tax or delivery, so let&apos;s keep looking.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2022/05/permatrack.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Permanent Roofline Lights" loading="lazy" width="1121" height="1500" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/permatrack.jpg 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/permatrack.jpg 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2022/05/permatrack.jpg 1121w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>credit: <a href="https://www.permatrack.us/shop/permatrack/">Permatrack</a></figcaption></figure><p>For the third option, we can use PVC pipe and clips for the same. PVC is cheap and I have a bunch of it from the display last year, along with <em>some</em> clips. I&apos;d have to order more (or print some), but they&apos;re not break-the-bank expensive. The main complaint I have with this method is the wiring is all out and not protected since the hole and bullet goes all the way through the PVC pipe (we&apos;re talking like 3/4&quot; pipe). Since these will be behind the fascia, it&apos;s not <em>horrible</em>, but it just feels a bit unfinished. Also, drilling a straight line in a PVC pipe without it &#xA0;curving is... tough.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2022/05/pvc-pixels.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Permanent Roofline Lights" loading="lazy" width="800" height="370" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/pvc-pixels.jpg 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2022/05/pvc-pixels.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>credit: <a href="https://mcoffing.wixsite.com/notwlights/forum/building-the-displays/rgb-pixel-outlines">NOTW Lights</a></figcaption></figure><p>The option I&apos;m looking to go with is using J-channel. This is usually used at the end of vinyl siding up against windows and doors. Generally, it&apos;s fairly decorative, so it will look a bit better. Also, the J-channel will give a kind of cable raceway to add a bit of protection and tidiness to the cable runs. Since the J-channel has slots for the screws to go in, it&apos;s easy to make mini adjustments to the fit and finish, even after a screw has been installed. And finally, the flat bottom of the channel is a bunch easier to get a consistent line out of. J-channel is about $2 per foot, delivered.</p><p>So, now that we have that settled, I just need to buy the J-track, spend an ungodly amount of time drilling (checks notes) <em>over 600 pixels,</em> do some wiring to allow for power injection and all that, install the lights into the J-channels, and then install the J-channels. EZPZ. That is a problem for future me!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing...

Now seems like a decent time to cover that and, more broadly, the various components which you can find in a moderately-sized display. So let&apos;s get into it!</p><p>To simplify things, you can think of a light display as equivalent to a person playing a piece of music on a piano. Or a person running a play in a sport. Or a person dancing. I play music, so I&apos;m going to stick with the piano metaphor. With that in mind, let&apos;s start with the music.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/compose.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Anatomy of a Light Display" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/compose.jpg 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/compose.jpg 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/compose.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>image credits: <a href="https://www.cutcommonmag.com/living-the-label-of-a-female-composer/">Cut Common</a>, <a href="https://www.joslynjourney.com/xlights-part-3-the-sequencer-tab/">The Joslyn Journey</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="composition">Composition</h3><p>At the very beginning, someone composes a song.

From here, the sheet music can be distributed to musicians who wish to play the song themselves. They may change it a little based on their own interpretation of the song, add their own flair, modify it to match their capabilities and instrumet, but the general idea remains.</p><p>When you save a sequence in xLights, you end up with a sequence file which serves the same purpose. This can be distributed to other people who can then use it in their own display. Of course, you can modify the sequence based on differences in display, preferences of colors or timing of patterns, or because you felt like doing something different with the megatree, but the base sequence will remain. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/translate.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Anatomy of a Light Display" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="624" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/translate.jpg 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/translate.jpg 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/translate.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>image credits: <a href="https://elevaterockschool.com/read-music-chords-scales/">Elevate Rock School</a>, <a href="https://www.pixelcontroller.com/store/">Pixel Controller.com</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="playing">Playing</h3><p>Once a musician has the sheet music, she reads through it to get a better understanding of how to play. While reading it, her eyes and part of her brain are translating the notation which is written on the pages into sounds, intensity, patterns, and chords, and is also starting to get an idea on how to physically play it. When she decides to sit down at the piano, an additional part of her brain starts to tell her fingers, hands, and feet how to move in order to recreate that which is written on the page.</p><p>Just as there are two things going on in the brain, so there are two different components in a light display. The first component is a player, probably something like a <a href="http://www.falconchristmas.com/wiki/Falcon_FPP">Falcon Player</a>, which translates the sequence file in the previous stage into some form of meaning. The second component, picks up that meaning and starts telling the lights how to flash.

For the purposes of this post, we&apos;ll be looking at only one of these circuits, one string of lights coming from one port; let&apos;s call this a run.</p><p>Some of the things which limit a run are the same as with other circuits: fuse(s) on the circuit (there&apos;s usually one built into the board per port), wire gauge, and wire length. On the Falcon F16, the ports have a 5A fuse, so we can&apos;t pass more current than 5A through this run without blowing the fuse. Wire gauge and length is.... complicated, so we&apos;re going to ignore it for the time being.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Cont_Wire_Chart.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Controller Port Limitations" loading="lazy" width="924" height="697" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Cont_Wire_Chart.jpg 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Cont_Wire_Chart.jpg 924w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>see?</figcaption></figure><p>For <em>typical</em> LEDs, the amperage of each RGB pixel is approx 60mA, or 0.06A. This suggests that we can run about 83 pixels on each port, after which point we risk blowing the fuse on the board.</p><p>This is where things start getting.... weird. If you plugged in a string of 83 pixels and put them to full white (100% brightness to each red, green, and blue pixel), you&apos;ll notice that they look fine... up until around pixel 50 or so, at which point, they start taking on a pinkish hue. Virtually nobody would consider the color the 83rd pixel is emitting &quot;white&quot;.</p><p>The reason for this dimming is because of a phenomenon called voltage drop. As you go down the line, each pixel consumes a little bit of power, which reduces the amount available for each pixel further down the line. This is fine in the beginning as each pixel has more than enough power to work with; a 5V pixel will work fine down to about 4V, for example. After a certain threshold (somewhere around 50 pixels), the pixel is unable to fully power all three LEDs, and thus they each have a lower brightness. There&apos;s a bunch of <a href="http://spikerlights.com/pwrinjection.aspx">charts and models</a> you can look at to get a richer understanding, but all you need to know is that this is a thing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Controller Port Limitations" loading="lazy" width="1264" height="1015" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG 1264w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Credit: http://spikerlights.com/calcpower.aspx</figcaption></figure><p>So that&apos;s two limits: how many pixels a port can provide power to (83 or so) and how many pixels with good color rendering a port can drive (50 or so). Let&apos;s assume that neither of these is a problem. We&apos;ll just avoid physics and say that any number of pixels can be powered without melting the board, and further assume that voltage drop is not a thing. We <em>still</em> will have limits to how many pixels a single port can drive, but this time it&apos;s how many can be updated every frame.</p><p>&quot;Frame&quot; is an animation term, hearkening back to the French &quot;fram&#xEA;z&quot; which means I&apos;m kidding I did literally zero research into the history of this terminology. I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s from photography (a photograph is a frame contained by the borders of the photo) and then was adopted by movies, which are just 24 images per second being shown to you to give an illusion of moving pictures. In animation, particularly in computer animation, it&apos;s a moment which is frozen in time, where some controller or artist has defined exactly what the display should look like for that very brief moment.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/aladdin-genie-mouth-drop.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Controller Port Limitations" loading="lazy" width="480" height="360"><figcaption>An example of a single frame</figcaption></figure><p>This is how pixel displays work. Many times per second, the controller tells every single pixel what color it should be, waits until the next update time, then tells every single pixel what color it should be again. Frame rate simply means &quot;how many frames are shown over time&quot; and is typically measured in frames per second. Refresh rate is directly related to this, but it typically describes how much time elapses between each refresh (frame) of the display and is typically measured in milliseconds or thousandths of a second. Common frame rates are 20fps and 40fps; the former has a refresh rate of 50ms and the latter has a refresh rate of 25ms.</p><p>Back to ports. Each port can only update a certain number of pixels in a given refresh rate time period; this is due to each pixel taking a tiny bit of time to take its portion of the message and pass the rest down the line, the speed of light (how fast the signal moves through the wires to the next pixel), and built-in overhead on the controller to determine what the next frame is going to look like. My controller (Falcon F16V3) can update 1024 pixels per port every frame, but only when running in 20fps; if I want 40fps, I have to drop my pixel count to around 600 pixels since the controller won&apos;t be able to keep up.</p><p>Fortunately, we can solve for two of these three main limitations. We can&apos;t do anything about the maximum number of pixels a single port can update; that&apos;s physics and computers and stuff, and it&apos;s pretty damn impressive that a controller can update 600 different tiny microcomputers (which is what LED pixels really are) across my front yard 40 times every single second. However, we <em>can </em>fix the much more restrictive limits of 50 pixels and 83 pixels by using power injection, and we&apos;ll get into that with the next post.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wiring Notes and Design Prep]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which I describe why writing down wiring details is helpful]]></description><link>https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/wiring-notes/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62a78a5510ae7100017f6453</guid><category><![CDATA[Pixels]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wiring]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Wickham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 20:04:45 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6077.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6077.jpg" alt="Wiring Notes and Design Prep"><p>One thing I&apos;ve found very helpful when building props is to write down various notes about wiring. Sure, there are going to be some rules or guidelines you should follow (e.g. DC+ goes to DC+, how to manage power injection, etc), but what wire colors are, what connectors you use, whether the male plug is on the incoming side of the prop or on the outgoing, etc. are going to vary based upon your preferences, the types of components you buy, etc.</p><p>To add to the difficulty, sometimes this stuff is not very well documented. For example, for the pixel strands I bought there is no documentation as to whether the signal goes from the male plug to the female plug or vice versa; you have to figure it out on your own.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wiring Notes and Design Prep" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 1600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>What is all this?</figcaption></figure><p>Thus, writing these things down is incredibly helpful. By doing some preliminary thinking and design work, you can simplify the process of wiring and reduce the possibility of bad wiring quite a lot.</p><p>You won&apos;t have to go back and figure out what you&apos;ve already done in order to try and match it. It&apos;s annoying to have to get a fully wired and functional prop out of storage to figure out which direction the current is flowing, which direction the plugs should go, etc. Further, if you always use the same practice for wiring things up, your system is more flexible and open to changes without having to rebuild connectors, etc.</p><p>At a minimum, these are the things I would write down:</p><ul><li>Which wire colors carry what type of current. Do this for pixel strands, other prewired props which need to be connected, signal cables running from the controllers to the props, and power injection.</li><li>What direction connectors face. I find it easiest to think of this as &quot;incoming&quot; and &quot;outgoing&quot;, but it&apos;s also commonly referred to as &quot;upstream&quot; and &quot;downstream&quot; (controller/power source is always &quot;outgoing&quot; or &quot;upstream&quot;). As an example, if you buy the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32739097740.html?">Ray Wu connectors</a>, it&apos;s common to wire the female plug (holes instead of prongs) to the <a href="https://www.pixelcontroller.com/store/products/57-5mm-connectors.html">controller connectors</a> which plug into the board. The direction doesn&apos;t matter as long as it&apos;s consistent.</li><li>Which wires go to which connector poles. This is useful mainly for power injection wires, but it really depends on how in-depth you get with your wiring.</li></ul><p>That&apos;s seems like very little, but do each of these for each of the wire types and it starts getting to be a bit of info. However, I promise that you will appreciate having this when you go months between building props and have completely forgotten which way everything goes.</p><p>For me, it ended up looking something like this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wiring Notes and Design Prep" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 1600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Don&apos;t worry if you can&apos;t read my writing; I&apos;m the only one who need to be able to &#x1F602;</figcaption></figure><p>As for that last bit about not connecting DC+ to signal cables?

One might want to do that if there are several groups of one type of model, then another group which has all of that model. I found an issue with how this works and am going to put a big caveat on using nested groups.</p><p>For example, on my house, I&apos;m planning to have five stars on my garage and five stars on my house. I would like to be have the option to control them separate to each other, so I have &quot;Stars - Garage&quot; and &quot;Stars - House&quot;. However, I also want to control all the stars together, so I want &quot;Stars - All&quot;; that way any time I add a star, I just add it to one group (say, &quot;Stars - House&quot;) and anything group that has that group nested (say, &quot;Stars - All&quot; or &quot;House - All&quot;) will automatically know about that new model.</p><p>However, this has a limitation during sequencing. When you apply effects, there is a &quot;Render Style&quot; option. In this, the default is to use all of the models in the group as a broad canvas onto which to apply the effect.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/grouped-2.gif" class="kg-image" alt="I Stand Corrected" loading="lazy" width="593" height="203"><figcaption>Effect applied to a group, Default rendering</figcaption></figure><p>However, you also have the option to tell it to apply the effect to each of the models under the group (one such value is &quot;Per Model Default&quot;). This is useful when you want to have, say, the same starburst effect on all the stars without having all the stars on the timeline individually and applying the effect to all of them. I touched on the differences in the model grouping post. The end result is the same as if you&apos;d applied the effects individually, but the same exact effect will be used and kept in sync.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/singles-2.gif" class="kg-image" alt="I Stand Corrected" loading="lazy" width="593" height="203"><figcaption>Effect applied to a group, Per Model Default rendering</figcaption></figure><p>The limitation is this: if you have nested groups, the groups which are nested will be rendered as a group instead of the individual models. Here&apos;s an example using my &quot;Stars - All&quot; group (hey now, I&apos;m an All Star...). For illustration purposes, I have both individual models and a nested group within this group so you can see the differences.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/high-level-group-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="I Stand Corrected" loading="lazy" width="805" height="358" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/high-level-group-1.gif 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/high-level-group-1.gif 805w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Effect applied to a group with individual models and a nested group, Default rendering</figcaption></figure><p>This is using the Default rendering on the top-level group. As you can see, the explosion goes out from the middle of the group and passes through all the stars. Let&apos;s see what happens when we change the Render Style to Per Model Default.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/per-model-default-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="I Stand Corrected" loading="lazy" width="805" height="358" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/per-model-default-1.gif 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/per-model-default-1.gif 805w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Effect applied to a group with individual models and a nested group, Per Model Default rendering</figcaption></figure><p>That&apos;s interesting, right? As you can see, each of the stars on the left bursts within the star itself, while on the right, the burst renders across all five stars. That&apos;s because the stars on the left are added to the group individually, whereas the stars on the right are added to the group within a nested group. </p><p>So we come to the crux: I am going to go back and, in <em>many</em> cases, change my groups to hold only models. In the long run, it is going to be a bit more maintenance as I add new models, but hopefully that&apos;ll be only like once or twice a year. However, with things on which I intend to never use Per Model Default rendering (e.g. my EVERYTHING group), I&apos;ll just keep with the nested groups, because damn are they convenient!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Starting a New Sequence]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which we prepare the canvas upon which we will create our work of art.]]></description><link>https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/dipping-your-toe-in-sequencing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62a78a5510ae7100017f6451</guid><category><![CDATA[Sequencing]]></category><category><![CDATA[xLights]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Wickham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 06:47:42 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/index.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/index.png" alt="Starting a New Sequence"><p>My last <a href="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/philosophy-of-sequencing/">post about sequencing</a> went hard in the paint on the <em>why</em> but didn&apos;t really touch on the <em>how</em>.

This may not be best practice; we&apos;ll find out later though, and it seems to work so far.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting a New Sequence" loading="lazy" width="438" height="306"></figure><p>To create a new sequence, open xLights, navigate to the Sequencer tab, and click &quot;New Sequence&quot;. &#xA0;It&apos;s the yellow page lookin&apos; icon in the upper left. You can also find it in the &quot;File&quot; menu, or using the keyboard shortcut <code>ctrl+n</code> (probably <code>cmd+n</code> on Mac, but I haven&apos;t installed xLights on my Mac yet);</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting a New Sequence" loading="lazy" width="601" height="422" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-14.png 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-14.png 601w"></figure><p>First thing you&apos;ll get is a dialog asking if you want a &quot;Musical Sequence&quot; or an &quot;Animation&quot;. The latter is just pretty light patterns which aren&apos;t set to music; you can totally do a show using this, use animations between sets, on holidays where there aren&apos;t as many songs, if you have only a few lights, etc. For this, we&apos;ll be syncing with music, so choose the &quot;Musical Sequence&quot; option. (Note; there are other tabs on this dialog; we&apos;re ignoring them as you don&apos;t need to play with them) You will be prompted to select a song; find the one you downloaded and open it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-15.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting a New Sequence" loading="lazy" width="595" height="466"></figure><p>Now you&apos;ll be asked to select either 40fps or 20fps for the framerate (the millisecond number in parenthesis are how many milliseconds each frame is allotted). Well, you can define the fps manually using the &quot;Custom&quot; button, but 40 and 20 are fine values; I wouldn&apos;t use Custom unless you have a reason.</p><p>40fps will give you smoother gradations and transitions between colors, along with being able to more closely time effects with the beat in the song. However, it comes at the cost of file sizes which are twice as large which can be a bad thing. From what I&apos;ve heard, 20fps is a fine option unless you know that your hardware (pixel controllers, animation player, network gear) can handle the larger file sizes. One example is that, if you choose to use 40fps, you have a limit of 680 pixels per port on the Falcon controllers, as opposed to the <em>possible</em> 1024 which each port can handle at 20fps. I&apos;ve spent many days (over a week?) diving into this and planning accordingly, so I&apos;m choosing 40fps.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-16.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting a New Sequence" loading="lazy" width="604" height="471" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-16.png 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-16.png 604w"></figure><p>Finally, you are prompted to select which models you want included from the start, then you can either &quot;Quick Start&quot; or go through &quot;More Options&quot;. For the models, you can always manage which models are visible/controllable in the sequencer after the fact; I generally choose to start with empty because it&apos;s easier to add a dozen or two groups/models than to remove three or four dozen models I&apos;m not going to use individually.</p><p>I genuinely have no idea what is under &quot;More Options&quot; </p><p>... clicks through</p><p>Hmmm, import sequences from other programs (or xLights), edit the metadata, import timings. All stuff we&apos;re not going to super worry about for this sequence. Cool, so just click the &quot;Quick Start&quot; button.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-17.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting a New Sequence" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1056" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-17.png 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-17.png 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/image-17.png 1600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/09/image-17.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>One brand new sequence</figcaption></figure><p>Okay! Now we do something which everyone online says to do: as soon as you open a sequence, save it right away; the reaosn they say this is saving kicks off a rendering pass. It will do nothing in this case but save the sequence; however, it&apos;s good to have something to quick save to; thus save it (I save it right next to the music file in my <code>songs</code> directory).</p><p>Awesome, now we have a blank slate!</p><p>Coming up in the next few posts, we&apos;ll get into managing the models which we are going to control in the sequencing pane, set up timing tracks to better syncronize and lay out our effects, then start putting down some effects.

This can be an interesting task, so I&apos;ll walk through what I did.</p><p>Caveat: you can likely get them cheaper than I did, but I am fortunate enough to have wiggle room in my budget. I&apos;ll mention some things which other people say they have done, but I can&apos;t vouch for them, though they do sound reasonable.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-8.png" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!" loading="lazy" width="606" height="412" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-8.png 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-8.png 606w"></figure><p>Caveat 2: I&apos;m not endorsing or sponsored by any of the vendors I&apos;m linking to here. In fact, were it not for my desire to give credit where it&apos;s due, I probably wouldn&apos;t include links, just steal the pictures. I may or may not be using the products I share below; I don&apos;t know. I haven&apos;t gotten that far.</p><p>First thing to do is to decide how many pixels. On the rooflines and straight runs, I opted to do a 2&quot; spacing which, judging by my existing attempt at pixel lighting, is fine. It&apos;s not excellent, but it&apos;s fine. When installing, I&apos;m planning on using some mounting material which will allow me to go to 1&quot; spacing if I desire, but that sounds a bit like overkill to me. A couple of examples are below. After I did all the calculations, I determined I&apos;d need 2,116 pixels for the outlines.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!" loading="lazy" width="480" height="640"><figcaption>Chromatrim, semi-rigid mounting at 1&quot; spacing in 4&apos; strips (<a href="https://boscoyostudio.com/product/chromatrim/">Boscoyo</a>)</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-7.png" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-7.png 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-7.png 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/image-7.png 1600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-7.png 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>megatree roll, 1&quot; spacing, flexible so you can just roll up the lights after the season (<a href="https://boscoyostudio.com/product/megatree-mounting-strip-heavy-duty-max-roll-200/">Boscoyo</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>I also used some retail props (the stars, arches, and spinners) to estimate the number of pixels for each of those. Of course, this is going to vary from place to place and what you want in yours, so do a bit of research (google &quot;holiday coro&quot;, &quot;christmas light rgb props&quot; and the like), find some you want, and look at the pixel count (in quite a few cases, the vendor has custom models for xLights; there will be a future post about that). The props ended up taking 2,788 pixels.</p><p>Finally, there was the megatree. These are somewhat easy to calculate as long as you know how dense you want it. I want more of a beginner&apos;s megatree (well, I <em>want</em> a huge one, but I&apos;m starting with a smaller one to see how it goes), so I&apos;m allocating about 800 pixels for that (50 per string, 16 strings around the tree; this is a fairly common configuration).</p><p>Grand total: 5,704 pixels in my xLights configuration.</p><p>Now that I&apos;d decided on a number, I started reading the forums (mainly <a href="https://www.auschristmaslighting.com">auschristmaslighting.com</a>, even though I&apos;m not in Australia; it&apos;s incredibly useful) and found that the three most common vendors are eBay, Amazon, and Aliexpress. Amazon is reliable and fast, but relatively expensive. Aliexpress is reliable and relatively inexpensive, but can be slower, eBay can be quite a bit cheaper, but you&apos;re sacrificing the reliability. I opted for Aliexpress.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!" loading="lazy" width="1589" height="850" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-9.png 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-9.png 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-9.png 1589w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now, on that forum, when it comes to purchases, <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/store/701799?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.593e4c15fD6DfX">Ray Wu&apos;s store</a> will come up a lot. This is a highly used vendor in this hobby and they have a ton of supplies for pretty great prices. However, I wanted to see what else was available because Aliexpress is HUGE (plus roughly 30% of the cost would have been shipping, and being a Prime member for years, I&apos;ve developed an allergy to paying for shipping).</p><p>I ended up buying from another vendor because I was able to get 1,000 pixel lots pretty inexpensively. I <em>did</em> find one vendor with free shipping, but paying for shipping ended up being cheaper when I bought the lots. A note on this a bit later. Any rate, the 6,000 lights were around $950, which is $0.16 per pixel; I understand that to be reasonable, though I have heard of others getting them for about half that. I placed my order on the 30th of Dec, and I received the first of two boxes today, Jan. 6 (I have a tracking number for the other box and it should be here soon). Not bad!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1191" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg 1600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/09/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>ten 500 pixel bags</figcaption></figure><p>Oh, I totally didn&apos;t talk about voltage in this post.

I&apos;m still trying to figure out what exactly to do for props and mounting, so that will have to come later. Full update when it happens, though.</p><p>Any rate, two things which came up as credible options. First off, apparently you can contact vendors on Aliexpress (Ray&apos;s name was brought up for this) and ask for a quote for the number of pixels you want. From what I understand (I heard this after I placed my order, so I didn&apos;t get an opportunity to find out, though I will probably purchase another thousand, or two so I may try then), he will often reduce or waive the shipping fee.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-10.png" class="kg-image" alt="We Have Pixels!" loading="lazy" width="1116" height="512" srcset="https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-10.png 600w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-10.png 1000w, https://wickedfoxlights.github.io/content/images/2021/09/image-10.png 1116w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Shipping cost ain&apos;t no joke; $16 for a $5 item.</figcaption></figure><p>Since in my case, shipping would have been around $300, that savings is nothing to sniff at.</p><p>Second credible option I&apos;ve heard: group buys. If you are getting into the hobby, I would suggest finding a forum (or forums) to join, then seek out folks in your area. There are (were; thanks COVID) meetups all over the world at least a couple times a year, and there can be vendors at these meetups, instructional sessions, demos, etc. But one other thing which is not uncommon is arranging group buys in order to get large bulk discounts; if 10 (or 50) people pool their orders and go through one vendor, they&apos;re likely to get a savings on cost and on shipping; then the items are distributed at the meetup.</p><p>Any rate, that&apos;s the cut and dry of how I got my pixels. Next time, I&apos;ll go into pixel voltage and how to decide what strands will work for you.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
