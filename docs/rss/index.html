Besides, it doesn&apos;t hurt that I&apos;ve been asked for an overview, so may as well take the opportunity! The main goal of this is not to be &quot;how to make a light show&quot;, but more along the lines of &quot;what goes into my light show&quot;. Of course, it could serve as a starting point for folks who want to get into it, at the very least understanding the roles of the various components involved.</p><p>There&apos;s a few different ways to approach this, but I think I&apos;ll describe my system in the way that I learned and built it up over the years. I&apos;ll start at the software layer, then follow that out step by step to the pixels on the house. However, please note that I&apos;m not going to go into huge (any?) detail about what props, pixels, how it&apos;s all built, stored, etc.; I&apos;m just going to focus more on the main components that let it happen.</p><h2 id="software-and-design"><strong> Software and Design</strong></h2><p>I think this is a great place to start because it&apos;s &quot;free&quot; (at least, for some definition of &quot;free&quot;). In this case, what we&apos;ll be working with is the sequencing software called <a href="https://xlights.org/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox" rel="noreferrer">xLights</a>. There are other systems that exist out there, but from basically everything I&apos;ve seen, xLights is as close to a standard as it gets. It&apos;s also open-source software and is absolutely free to use.The developers provide a weekly update basically year round, and there have been a lot of improvements in the several years I&apos;ve been using it.</p><p>xLights performs three different functions in my light show and a special bonus function that I don&apos;t use:</p><ol><li>Design and layout of the show</li><li>Sequencing of individual songs</li><li>Mapping of software pixels to real-life pixels</li><li>(bonus) scheduling and running the light show</li></ol><h3 id="layout"><strong>Layout</strong></h3><p>The first thing you&apos;ll need to do in xLights is to design your light show. Drop a picture of your house into the app then start adding as many or as few props as you&apos;d like (a &quot;prop&quot; being a single element of your show, like a single star, candy cane, line of lights on your eaves, etc). There are a lot of generic props you can use, or you can download the layouts for specific props you can buy from places like <a href="https://www.holidaycoro.com/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">HolidayCoro</a>, <a href="https://gilbertengineeringusa.com/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Gilbert Engineering</a>, or <a href="https://boscoyostudio.com/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Boscoyo Studio</a>. This part is completely free and can help you plan what your show will look like so you can decide what props to buy.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2026/01/xlights-layout-view.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1321" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/xlights-layout-view.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/xlights-layout-view.jpg 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/xlights-layout-view.jpg 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2026/01/xlights-layout-view.jpg 2165w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">xLights Layout View</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="sequencing"><strong>Sequencing</strong></h3><p>This part comes next because it is still free, but you can <em>_certainly_</em> spend money on it. On the &quot;Sequencer&quot; tab in xLights, you can create a new sequence based on an mp3 that you have available. xLights will parse that mp3 and put it in a timeline view, not dissimilar to video editing. You&apos;ll then bring whichever props you want to control onto the timeline as layers, then start assigning effects from effects selection and setting up the timing. This can be a very short or very long process, depending on how intricate you want to be; indeed, if you draft all your own sequences, this may be the part which takes the most time. On the other hand, this is arguably the most impactful, because a good sequence on a bad display is more likely to impress than a bad sequence on a good display.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2026/01/xlights-sequence-view.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1170" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/xlights-sequence-view.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/xlights-sequence-view.jpg 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/xlights-sequence-view.jpg 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2026/01/xlights-sequence-view.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">xLights Sequence View</span></figcaption></figure><p>Full disclosure, I&apos;ve only created 5 or 6 of my own sequences, simply because it can be pretty complex and I don&apos;t feel that I have the creative juice in that way. The shortest took around 4 hours to do because I was just kinda slapping stuff together (but it still has to be <em>timed</em> perfectly!), and the longest took me closer to 12 hours because I was still learning the process. However, here&apos;s two that I&apos;m particularly proud of; the first is the most recent one I did and took around 8 hours, the second took closer to 12 and was at my old house (editor&apos;s note; just re-watched the second one and it <em>_might_</em> be a bit much... just sayin.)</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxQk6PByMDg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="Carte Blanq and Maxx Power - Max Verstappen (xLights Sequence)"></iframe><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Formula 1 fans never saw this one coming</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qong_5IfM1c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="Leo Moracchioli - All I Want For Christmas Is You (metal cover) (2021 Christmas Light Show)"></iframe><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At my old place, and definitely not as good quality video, but still okay</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Typically I end up looking for sequences from other people who have more desire to do this. This is where money <em>can</em> come into it. There are some share sites with free sequences, such as <a href="https://xlightsseq.com/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">xLights Sequences</a> or <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/listentoourlights/sequencing?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Listen to our Lights</a>, though I&apos;ve found the quality can be hit or miss. I&apos;ve used a couple of these as starting points, just to kinda fill in the song, then I can go back and edit the sequence to fit more what I want it to be. There&apos;s also pay sites which can charge anywhere from $10 to $150 for a single sequence. <a href="https://magicallightshows.com/collections/xlights-sequences?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Magical Light Shows</a> is top of the game here (run by Tom Betgeorge who has probably the best light shows on YouTube),but I also buy from <a href="https://rgb-sequences.com/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">RGB Sequences</a>, <a href="https://bflightshows.com/collections/sequences?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">BF Light Shows</a>, and others.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/enhhtPZMwCE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="2025 Full Christmas Show - 4K"></iframe><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Tom Betgeorge&apos;s show is what all light shows like mine want to be when they grow up; alas, it shall never be</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>One thing <em>all</em> of these have in common is that you will have to import and adapt them to your own layout. xLights makes it straightforward to do and there are tutorials on YouTube about how to do this. Also, you&apos;re fully able to tweak the sequence how you want; it&apos;s on your computer and everything is tweakable, so have fun with it!</p><p>When complete, you&apos;ll run a render which basically creates a binary file which tells every pixel what color it should be 40x per second. That will get sent to the controllers, but mapping needs to come first.</p><h3 id="mapping"><strong>Mapping</strong></h3><p>By this point, you may not have spent any money, and technically you don&apos;t have to in order to do this step.... but it doesn&apos;t really make sense to do this without some hardware. This will <em>technically</em> come later in the process but this is my post and I&apos;m keeping xLights stuff altogether, so there.</p><p>Mapping is the process by which you tell xLights where your lights actually live. Really briefly, every pixel is made up of 3 channels: R, G, B. So for 3 pixels, you&apos;ll have 9 channels, one for R, G, and B for each of the pixels. All this data is sent down the same wire, and each pixel takes the next three integers of data for its three channels, then sends the rest of the packet to the next pixel (or something like that). Thus, xLights has to organize the entire display into <em>effectively</em> a single line of pixels, based on the pixel order in each prop. However, since the pixels process the signal in serial, and since there&apos;s some latency involved in each pixel&apos;s processing, there&apos;s an upper limit to the number of pixels in a line in order to hit fps targets. I target 40fps, and the upper limit for that is ~670 pixels, so I try to target 650 pixels just for some breathing room.</p><p>Now, my display has around 5000 pixels, so in order to allow for displays larger than ~670 pixels at a high frame rate, hardware allows for individual ports to be processed in parallel. And this is where the mapping comes in: the mapping portion sets up where the props are in relation to each other; which prop is the first on a particular port, which comes second, etc. Without this step, xLights would have no idea how to organize the binary data which is rendered and provided to the controllers.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2026/01/xlights-mapping-view.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1201" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/xlights-mapping-view.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/xlights-mapping-view.jpg 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/xlights-mapping-view.jpg 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2026/01/xlights-mapping-view.jpg 2252w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">xLights Mapping View</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="hardware"><strong>Hardware</strong></h2><p>Okay, so now we&apos;re spending money. What are we spending it on? Well, pixels and props, obviously. But what else do we need? Here&apos;s what I have in my system, why I have it, and what I&apos;d replace it with (if appropriate). There&apos;s two main places I have hardware, under my eaves and attached to the pole for my tree.</p><h3 id="scheduler-and-main-controller"><strong>Scheduler and Main Controller</strong></h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2026/01/IMG_3874.JPG" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/IMG_3874.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/IMG_3874.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/IMG_3874.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2026/01/IMG_3874.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Eaves boxes, including the scheduler (left), main controller (center), and a child controller (right)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I mentioned earlier that one could use xLights as a controller, and that&apos;s true. However, I don&apos;t have a good way to run a <em>wired</em>connection from my computer to my light show controllers, so I don&apos;t use that functionality. I want to keep it wired between the main controller and the subcontrollers so wifi hiccups don&apos;t end up making things go out of sync. (there are ways to incorporate wifi, basically giving each subcontroller a copy of the sequences and using wifi to just perform synchronization operations, but I prefer all wired).</p><p>For this role, I use a Raspberry Pi 4 running <a href="https://falconchristmas.github.io/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Falcon Player</a>. It has full playback controls, allowing you to run and stop sequences as well as set up different playlists, schedule what time you want them to run, etc. xLights seamlessly hooks into Falcon Player and uploads all the necessary stuff (music, sequence, video, etc) that each sequence needs. Falcon Player also acts as the main show controller, storing the rendered sequences and sending the correct data to the appropriate subcontrollers.</p><p>My Pi connects via wifi to my home network and to the show network via ethernet; I have a network switch connecting the pi to the two subcontrollers. Interestingly, the Falcon Player also acts as a network proxy to the subcontrollers so I can log into them directly if I need to do some configuration changes.</p><p>Also in the box are the network switch (bottom left) and FM Radio Transmitter (top right)</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2026/01/IMG_3878.JPG" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/IMG_3878.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/IMG_3878.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/IMG_3878.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2026/01/IMG_3878.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Main controller box</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, I have a dual outdoor-rated smart switch for turning on the light show subcontrollers and the Falcon Player separately. I used to use Falcon Player exclusively to schedule and control the light show, but I&apos;ve since ported everything into Home Assistant through the Falcon Player&apos;s MQTT integration. This way my schedules are all in the same place and I have the ability to integrate with other stuff should I need to.</p><h3 id="subcontrollers"><strong>Subcontrollers</strong></h3><p>I have two subcontrollers: one for my tree since I got the tree as a part of a kit, and one for the rest of my show.</p><h4 id="tree-controller"><strong>Tree controller</strong></h4><p>This is the simpler of the two; as mentioned, I purchased it as part of a tree kit (Quick Pixel MegaTree kit from HolidayCoro). It&apos;s a HinksPix Pro with 16 ports; basically any 16 port controller will be overkill for this application, but it makes it super easy; I just connect an ethernet cable from the switch, attach to power provided by the smart switch (covered later), and it&apos;s running.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2026/01/tree-kit.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="201"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The tree kit as seen on Holiday Coro</span></figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2026/01/IMG_3881.JPG" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/IMG_3881.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/IMG_3881.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/IMG_3881.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2026/01/IMG_3881.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Tree controller box with power supply (top) and tree subcontroller (bottom)</span></figcaption></figure><h4 id="everything-else-controller"><strong>Everything Else controller</strong></h4><p>This was the first controller I got; a Falcon F4V2. It&apos;s... fine. Unlike other boards, this one has 4 physical ports on it, but I&apos;ve added an expansion board which allows me to connect up to 2 remote boards using ethernet, each of which also provide 4 ports, for a total of 12 ports; the white and black with a yellow zip tie are plugged in to the expansion board. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2026/01/IMG_3877.JPG" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/IMG_3877.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/IMG_3877.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/IMG_3877.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2026/01/IMG_3877.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Main subcontroller</span></figcaption></figure><p>The children of this board are simple receiver boards - called Smart Receivers - in boxes with power supplies in them. The boxes both look identical; one is in the eaves, and the other is on the mega tree pole; both are connected via ethernet.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2026/01/IMG_3876.JPG" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/IMG_3876.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/IMG_3876.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/IMG_3876.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2026/01/IMG_3876.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the smart receiver boxes with power distribution board (left), receiver board (center), and power supply (right)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing to note in all of these &quot;everything else&quot; controller boxes is a power distribution board. As mentioned, each port can control ~600 pixels (just rounding for now), but each port can only <em>power</em> ~300 pixels, so we have to do some power injection towards the back half of the line of props on the port. The power distribution block simply gives us a simple interface for adding those power injection cables. And, of course, the power supply, 5V at 300W.</p><h2 id="how-to-improve"><strong>How to improve</strong></h2><p>Hmmm, I think that&apos;s it for the hardware and everything. So I should tell you what I <em>don&apos;t</em> like. First on the list, the boxes. I like the one I got with the Hinks Pix a lot more than the other three I have, which are just too shallow. Plus, the box for the Hinks Pix has external plugs for network, which is nice.</p><p>Second, wiring. I would <em>love</em> to find a way to wire things up so I don&apos;t have to run network cables and power halfway across the front of my house under eaves that are 12 feet off the ground. It&apos;s super inconvenient and I have to put it up and take it down every year. This summer I <em>swear</em> I am going to improve this, and that&apos;s different to last year when I said that, and the year before, and...</p><p>Third, all my stuff still works fine, but it&apos;s several years old at this point; I think I owe it to myself to see if there&apos;s something it makes sense to improve before something dies mid show.</p><p>Fourth, one thing that really helped was &quot;power injecting&quot; each prop into itself (I know that I said I wasn&apos;t really going to talk about props, but tough). When I first built my props, I had data connectors separate to power connectors, so every prop needed two connections. This was very bulky, very cumbersome, and a waste of money and time since I chose to build the connectors to &quot;save money&quot; (spoiler: I did not in fact save money). Last year, I rewired all my props so that the V+ and Ground wires at the input and at the output of the prop are connected to each other. In practice, that means that the first pixel and last pixel are the same distance and number of pixels away from the power cord instead of the last pixel being far away. If a prop has more than ~120 pixels, I&apos;d also connect power somewhere in the middle, too.Basically, you don&apos;t want any pixel more than 50 pixels away from a power source, else voltage drop gets bad; therefore, I just distribute the power from the input throughout the prop as needed so all pixels get about the same power. This also helps the power move along down the line of props since, from a power perspective, all the props are <em>basically</em> wired in parallel. Perhaps I&apos;ll write a post detailing what I mean here.</p><h2 id="wrap-up"><strong>Wrap up</strong></h2><p>Okay, I think that&apos;s about it; can&apos;t think of anything else that would go in an overview.

In response, this post will be an overview of the system, giving a bit more detail about how everything works together. For those starting out, this isn&apos;t really a step-by-step guide since your own tastes, budget, and display area will be different to mine, but it should give you enough perspective for a good start on your own display.</p><p>For a broad overview of what components there are in a display and what roles, they play, I <a href="ghost.wicked.fox/the-anatomy-of-a-light-display/">wrote a post which fills that role</a>. It&apos;s been a while since I posted it, but the content there is still relevant. I&apos;ll be going deeper on the concepts I presented in that post, so if you feel lost or want a primer first, feel free to check it out!</p><p>Note: this is going to be a long article, so get comfy!</p><h2 id="props">Props</h2><p>There are a total of 49 props on my house of various sizes and shapes:</p><ul><li>15 stars, each with 90 pixels</li><li>4 22&quot; spinners, each with 85 pixels</li><li>2 36&quot; spinners, each with 193 pixels</li><li>4 windows, each with between 70 and 102 pixels</li><li>3 permanently installed runs on the eaves, with a combined 602 pixels split over 8 props</li><li>16 other house outline runs with a combined 658 pixels</li></ul><p>All together, that makes 4080 pixels in this display. That&apos;s fewer pixels than I had last year, despite having a larger house (and is also something I&apos;m going to remedy for next year :-p)</p><p>When it comes to the data and power connections into and out of the props, there are two different categories of props which describe the connections therein: shapes and lines. While I am not going to get hyper detailed about each of these (I&apos;ll make a post about each type, how I wired them, and why I did so), I&apos;ll go over some basics.</p><h3 id="shapes">Shapes</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/12/IMG_8446.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Christmas Show Overview - 2022 Edition" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_8446.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_8446.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_8446.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_8446.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>22&quot; spinner with 85 pixels</figcaption></figure><p>In this display, these are going to be the stars and spinners, but also applies to the arches, peace spikes, tombstones, spiders, and spider web from other displays/occasions). As a general rule, there is one plug for power for every 300 pixels in the prop, one plug for data in for every 600 pixels in the prop, and one for data out; these numbers are due to the capacity of the controllers and power distribution boards I use. Making the plugs as generic and modular as possible allows me to relocate the props without having to change the wiring based on where it may lie in a signal port&apos;s run (more on ports later or in <a href="ghost.wicked.fox/wiring-props-and-power-injection/">this post</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/12/IMG_8459.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Christmas Show Overview - 2022 Edition" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_8459.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_8459.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_8459.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_8459.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Stars with 90 pixels each, showcasing the mounts crafted from PVC and sandbags to ensure they don&apos;t fly away</figcaption></figure><p>In all cases, the data in and data out plugs only carry data and DC-; all the DC+ comes from the power plugs. I do this to ensure the highest amount of modularity for the props; since you shouldn&apos;t connect DC+ coming from two different fuses, and power ports each have their own fuse, isolating the DC+ to a single prop is the easiest way to prevent issues. This adds a small amount of complexity and, frankly, annoyance since it&apos;s possible to drive multiple small props (like the peace spike) straight from the controller without power injection; however, I decided that being consistent requires less thought while setting up the system at the cost of running a bit more cable. </p><p>As for the backing material, most of them are made from corrugated plastic (called coro) from various different vendors. When you purchase them, they come with holes for the pixels already cut into them; all you have to do is install the pixels and wire them up. The downside is that this is what <em>most</em> people do, so when you see displays, you can see the Holiday Coro stars, the Boscoyo spinners, etc. Personally, I don&apos;t have the patience to design my own props, so I will continue using the prefab coro blanks, but one can buy coro on their own and have it laser cut, and sometimes the companies selling these prop blanks will do custom props for people if they ask.</p><h3 id="lines">Lines</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/12/IMG_8448.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Christmas Show Overview - 2022 Edition" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_8448.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_8448.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_8448.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_8448.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>One of the vertical lines; holes drilled into 1/2&quot; PVC to mount the pixels. You can see more on the window in the background</figcaption></figure><p>These are customized to specific parts of my house, so they are optimized more for installation and removal rather than for isolation from each other. To that end, I do power injection wherever it&apos;s convenient, share DC+ between sections when I can, and generally try to minimize the amount of cabling which has to be run.</p><p>Many of these are made from PVC, which takes a lot of time since you have to drill the holes for the pixels yourself. I drilled 1,688 holes for my display this year, so I&apos;m very familiar with how much time this takes. However, the plus side is building props from PVC - especially for the lines around your house - is that they are very easy to install due to using PVC clips which screw into your house, they store really easily if you have the room (above my garage door is where mine will go off season) and the pixels end up looking very lined up. Further, since PVC is somewhat flexible, you can follow some curves or make curved props like arches relatively easily.</p><p>My eaves are built using vinyl J-channel and installed in such a way that they will be up year round. I wrote <a href="ghost.wicked.fox/permanent-roofline-lights/">this post</a> on the subject a while ago</p><h2 id="cabling">Cabling</h2><p>I use two completely different types of cable in my display: signal and power. The cables themselves are considerably different, the ends are completely incompatible, there is generally no confusing the two. This makes it very easy to determine where the power is going and where the signal is going at a glance, and completely eliminates the possibility to connect a power cable to a data plug or vice versa.</p><h3 id="data">Data</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/12/IMG_8457.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Christmas Show Overview - 2022 Edition" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_8457.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_8457.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_8457.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_8457.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Data cable</figcaption></figure><p>The data cables I use are all assembled by the manufacturer and is ready to go when I receive it. I generally receive 4&apos; lengths and 10&apos; lengths which I combine as needed to run from controllers to props or between props. For longer runs (more than two 10&apos; lengths), I&apos;ll install a signal booster between the last part of the long run and the prop. However, since the booster requires DC+ and, as mentioned before, I don&apos;t pass DC+ out of props, the signal booster will only work between the controller and the first prop; therefore, I have to make sure I don&apos;t do runs longer than ~20&apos; between props because I can&apos;t boost the signal and it could deteriorate across runs longer than this. Personally, I&apos;m using the xConnect brand of cable ends for pigtails on the props or on the prefab cables I buy; nothing wrong with other connector types, these are just the ones I purchased first and there&apos;s no reason to change.</p><h3 id="power">Power</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/12/IMG_8458.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Christmas Show Overview - 2022 Edition" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_8458.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_8458.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_8458.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_8458.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Power cables</figcaption></figure><p>The power cables I custom build from bulk 12ga or 14ga two-conductor wire and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FP1HXHQ?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">Muyi connectors</a>. I built a bunch of 4&apos; and 10&apos; lengths to match the data cables I have, but power injection is different. Whereas data cables are a single line and each input has one output, power can branch off multiple times with no problems (technically this is what happens at each pixel too); therefore I have had to create a ton of tee junctions. These junctions have one input and two outputs so I can have a line which branches at each of several props, one tee at each prop. I&apos;ve built a bunch of standalone tees for generic use, but also have built some whole cable assemblies with multiple soldered tees for specifically placed props. I built all of those at my old house (believe it or not, it was faster to build these assemblies than the individual tees) so the spacing no longer makes sense for my current display.</p><p>I mentioned earlier I built a bunch of 4&apos; or 10&apos; lengths, but I also have several much longer cables (30&apos; or more) using 12ga for less voltage drop. These are handy because you can have half as many pixels on a power port as on a data port, so you end up running twice as much power cable and it&apos;s easier to build one long cable which reaches way over there than several shorter modular cables. A good mix of each is a good idea too.</p><h2 id="pixels">Pixels</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/12/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Christmas Show Overview - 2022 Edition" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="595" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/12/Image-from-iOS--37--1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>9 bags with 500 pixels each</figcaption></figure><p>I use exclusively 5V RGB pixels, though I may use 12V if I build some really high density props since 12V requires less power injection. Generally, I build props with the pixels and leave them in until I decide to completely scrap the prop, so even though I have fewer pixels this year, I purchased about 1000 <em>more</em> pixels for building props this year. I&apos;ve bought from Ali Express and the Alitove brand from Amazon and there doesn&apos;t seem to be a major difference in quality. On the other hand, there <em>is</em> a difference in color, both of the wire and of the pixels themselves, so if you buy from multiple sources, you should be careful about mixing and matching.</p><p>For building props and getting the pigtail ends onto the props, I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MLN4P5F?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">solder seal connectors</a>. I cannot sing their praises enough. They&apos;re easy to install and provide a reasonably durable connection, doing both weather sealing and soldering of the wires together. I <em>probably shouldn&apos;t</em>, but I regularly shove a 14ga and 22ga wire into each end of the blue connectors and they seem to hold up well.</p><h2 id="power-1">Power</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/12/IMG_8454.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Christmas Show Overview - 2022 Edition" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_8454.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_8454.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_8454.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_8454.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Mean Well power supply.

The only things which don&apos;t use the 5V output from the power supply are the Falcon Player and the FM transmitter; those are both plugged into the wall.

Falcon Player is an operating system and piece of software which is capable of controlling multiple pixel controllers, as well as coordinating with other Players to synchronize larger displays. While it can be used on many different single-board computers, I&apos;m using a Raspberry Pi 4b with 4Gb of RAM. Its responsibility in my show is to do the scheduling (which playlist should play at what time), content management (songs, sequences, playlists), and playing the song in time to the sequence via the audio out. I can use its web interface to control the playlists and playback and to configure the controllers it communicates with.

Its responsibility in my show is to receive the sequence data coming from the Falcon Player and split it into signals that are sent out over each data port. It natively supports 4 ports, but I also have the expansion card which extends it to 12 ports using smart receivers which are connected to the F4V3 via ethernet cables. Each port can send data to up to 680 pixels running at 40fps, or up to 1024 pixels at 20fps; I generally try to keep it to 600 or fewer pixels per port since that means each data port on the controller (and smart receiver) gets two power ports from the power distribution board for a 1:1 controller-to-distribution-board ratio. The main controller is where I configure how many pixels are on each port and, optionally, configure each individual prop on each port for testing purposes; this would allow me to, say, reduce the brightness for high-density props separately to the rest of the show.</p><h3 id="smart-receiver">Smart Receiver</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/12/IMG_8456-1.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Christmas Show Overview - 2022 Edition" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_8456-1.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_8456-1.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_8456-1.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_8456-1.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Falcon Smart Receiver</figcaption></figure><p>Smart Receivers are essentially remotely controlled followers to extend the number of ports available on a controller while also allowing the board to be physically closer to the pixels. Since a show can spread over large areas, positioning a smart receiver closer to distant props means you only have to run an ethernet and AC mains power to a box containing a smart receiver, a power supply, and a power distribution board, rather than 4 ports of data cables and 8 ports of power cables over long distances. I have two of these, the max that can be controlled by the F4V3.</p><h2 id="sequencing">Sequencing</h2><p>All of my sequencing is done within <a href="https://www.xlights.org/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">xLights</a>, which is a fantastic piece of software for designing shows. For the most part, I purchase sequences from various different websites, including <a href="https://rgbsequences.net/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">rgbsequences.net</a>, <a href="https://showstoppersequences.com/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">showstoppersequences.com</a>, and <a href="magicallightshows.com/">magicallightshows.com</a>. I also browse through the free sequences from <a href="xlightsseq.com">xlightsseq.com</a> and a dedicated <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6gSkzp9OlvuV3FmaEtBY19HMUU?resourcekey=0-so_9NkUjukTnvoNuqEV5Wg&amp;ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Google drive for xLights sequence sharing</a>. I also use xLights to define the various models which drive the props on the house, assign the models to ports, etc.</p><h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2><h3 id="fm-transmitter">FM Transmitter</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/12/IMG_8451.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Christmas Show Overview - 2022 Edition" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_8451.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_8451.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_8451.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_8451.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I have a cheap transmitter that accepts 3.5mm audio cable and transmits the incoming audio over a radio station that I can configure. The signal is acceptably strong; there&apos;s virtually zero distortion or static when watching the show from the intended areas, and the signal falls off after a block or two so it doesn&apos;t disrupt things too much. There are controllers which have a built in slot for an optional FM transmitter (Kulp boards, for example), but this has been working fine for me.</p><h3 id="weather-boxes">Weather Boxes</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/12/IMG_8449.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Christmas Show Overview - 2022 Edition" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_8449.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_8449.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_8449.JPG 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_8449.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I am using the large boxes you&apos;ll typically see around irrigation to hold the various electronics. They&apos;re mounted to the walls under my eaves so they are not quite as likely to get water in them. I drilled vent holes in them with the intention of adding hoods, but then I never added the hoods, so I taped over teh holes, my reasoning being it&apos;s <em>cold</em> when the show is running, so the components are not in danger of overheating.</p><h3 id="outdoor-smart-switch">Outdoor Smart Switch</h3><p>I&apos;m using a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B091FXH2FR?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug with two sockets</a> which I have connected to Home Assistant; using the automations, I turn the power to the pixels and controllers on at sundown each night, and leave the Falcon Player on perpetually. </p><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2><p>Overall, there are a lot of moving components to my system, but it looks more complex than it actually is. For the most part, each port is duplicating the others; the props and models may be shaped differently and have different numbers of pixels, but the concept and how they get connected are all identical. As the show grows, it will necessarily butt up against limits which will require more complex expansions, but again, the concepts and execution will be carbon copies of what already exists.</p><p>From here, I&apos;d like to start a series wherein I get more detailed about each of the props and equipment I built to highlight some of the limitations and decisions which were made along the way. Eventually, this will culminate in a full wiring diagram for the show. For the meantime, thank you for reading this far!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Permanent Roofline Lights]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which we decide the best way to install permanent LEDs]]></description><link>http://ghost.wicked.fox/permanent-roofline-lights/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62a78a5510ae7100017f6464</guid><category><![CDATA[Hardware]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pixels]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Wickham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 05:46:58 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/06/j-channel.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/06/j-channel.jpg" alt="Permanent Roofline Lights"><p>Now that we&apos;re in a new house, redesigning basically the entire display is going to be necessary. It&apos;s a bit of a bummer that this has to be done so soon after designing the last display, but an evolving display was always in the cards, so that evolution is just going to be a bit more... aggressive this year!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/05/evolution.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Permanent Roofline Lights" loading="lazy" width="600" height="452" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/05/evolution.jpg 600w"><figcaption>like this, only... less so. credit: <a href="http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/webproj/212_spring_2017/Andrew_Adler/Physics_of_Pokemon/evolution.html?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">The Physics of Pokemon</a></figcaption></figure><p>However, first things first. We really enjoyed having the &quot;permanent&quot; lights up on the roofline for the previous several years, so we want to have that again. Perhaps something a bit more... polished? Something that looks a bit more like it&apos;s meant to be permanent? I <em>guess</em> there&apos;s nothing wrong with just draping 2&quot; PVC pipe over the gutter, but we have EXPERIENCE now; we can do better than that! </p><p>I&apos;ve been reading a bunch about various different methods of installing permanent lights on the roofline, so lots of different thoughts and approaches. However, three are really worth considering, in my opinion.</p><p>First, one clarification. I say &quot;roofline&quot;, but I want something that looks a bit more polished and is generally kinda hidden and out of the way. At the last place, the white PVC blended well enough with the white gutters and trim, but you could still see all the pixels and, while it wasn&apos;t <em>bad</em>, we can do better.</p><p>Thus, the goal is to install the lights on the inside of the fascia with the lights facing downward, just peeking out past the fascia. Note that we don&apos;t have soffits, so the rear of the fascia is totally open. By installing this way, when the lights aren&apos;t on, they&apos;re almost invisible. This mounting also has a couple side benefits, the biggest one being that the lights are out of the elements; they won&apos;t be rained on, will be somewhat protected from the wind, and won&apos;t get direct sunlight.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/05/fascia-board-01.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Permanent Roofline Lights" loading="lazy" width="800" height="534" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/fascia-board-01.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/05/fascia-board-01.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>but flush with the bottom</figcaption></figure><p>So, let&apos;s talk about installation methods. As mentioned, there are four opions, and we&apos;ll go through them each.</p><p>First, there&apos;s LED strips with aluminum channels and diffusers. These generally look really good and polished since they are intended to be more visible. Also, due to the higher pixel density (sometimes much higher) animations and transitions look smoother, an effect which is enhanced by the diffuser. However, there are some things I don&apos;t like about them. First, power injection is a bit harder. It&apos;s not <em>hard</em>, but it requires soldering and stripping back some weatherproofing, then adding hot glue and heat shrink to make it weatherproof again. Second they&apos;re harder to repair; replacing a single pixel in a string is easy; in a strip, it&apos;s hard. Third, I haven&apos;t had much luck with the adhesive in them, so they could end up flopping around in the channel. Finally, not much room to run power injection wire in the channel to begin with.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/05/led-strip.webp" class="kg-image" alt="Permanent Roofline Lights" loading="lazy" width="1413" height="667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/led-strip.webp 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/led-strip.webp 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/05/led-strip.webp 1413w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>credit: <a href="https://www.derunledlights.com/complete-guide-permanent-install-led-strip-christmas-lights/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Derun LED Lights</a></figcaption></figure><p>Since strips themselves don&apos;t seem to be great, let&apos;s look at LED bullets. Using bullets (pixels, whatever) is familiar to me, and I know how to handle them, so that&apos;s a plus. Also... I have a <em>bunch</em>, so I don&apos;t have to buy more, which is a <em>huge</em> plus. Therefore, the next three options will use pixels.</p><p>Option 2 is using LED bullets with Permatrack. Permatrack is a purpose-built product for mounting these bullets to a house permanently. It seems to be simple to mount, has a channel for running wires, and - importantly - has predrilled holes for the pixels at a good spacing. They also look <em>fantastic</em>. This would provide less time from purchase to installation because I wouldn&apos;t have to build a jig and drill several hundred holes, and <em>could</em> be easier to install. However, this is the most expensive bullet mounting option, coming in around $4 per foot before tax or delivery, so let&apos;s keep looking.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/05/permatrack.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Permanent Roofline Lights" loading="lazy" width="1121" height="1500" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/permatrack.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/permatrack.jpg 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/05/permatrack.jpg 1121w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>credit: <a href="https://www.permatrack.us/shop/permatrack/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Permatrack</a></figcaption></figure><p>For the third option, we can use PVC pipe and clips for the same. PVC is cheap and I have a bunch of it from the display last year, along with <em>some</em> clips. I&apos;d have to order more (or print some), but they&apos;re not break-the-bank expensive. The main complaint I have with this method is the wiring is all out and not protected since the hole and bullet goes all the way through the PVC pipe (we&apos;re talking like 3/4&quot; pipe). Since these will be behind the fascia, it&apos;s not <em>horrible</em>, but it just feels a bit unfinished. Also, drilling a straight line in a PVC pipe without it &#xA0;curving is... tough.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/05/pvc-pixels.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Permanent Roofline Lights" loading="lazy" width="800" height="370" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/pvc-pixels.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2022/05/pvc-pixels.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>credit: <a href="https://mcoffing.wixsite.com/notwlights/forum/building-the-displays/rgb-pixel-outlines?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">NOTW Lights</a></figcaption></figure><p>The option I&apos;m looking to go with is using J-channel. This is usually used at the end of vinyl siding up against windows and doors. Generally, it&apos;s fairly decorative, so it will look a bit better. Also, the J-channel will give a kind of cable raceway to add a bit of protection and tidiness to the cable runs. Since the J-channel has slots for the screws to go in, it&apos;s easy to make mini adjustments to the fit and finish, even after a screw has been installed. And finally, the flat bottom of the channel is a bunch easier to get a consistent line out of. J-channel is about $2 per foot, delivered.</p><p>So, now that we have that settled, I just need to buy the J-track, spend an ungodly amount of time drilling (checks notes) <em>over 600 pixels,</em> do some wiring to allow for power injection and all that, install the lights into the J-channels, and then install the J-channels. EZPZ. That is a problem for future me!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing...

Taking into consideration the design of the layout, the number of lights, where they are placed, etc., you program them to make patterns animated over time, the end result being a file which can be passed to the next step.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/instructions.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Anatomy of a Light Display" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/instructions.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/instructions.jpg 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/instructions.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>image credits: Wikimedia Commons, <a href="https://auschristmaslighting.com/threads/xl4-shows-difference-between-two-xlights-autocreate-sequences.7142/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">smeighan on auschristmaslighting</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3><p>Once a song is composed, the composer writes down very detailed instructions on how to play the song, using a notation familiar to musicians; this is known as sheet music. From here, the sheet music can be distributed to musicians who wish to play the song themselves. They may change it a little based on their own interpretation of the song, add their own flair, modify it to match their capabilities and instrumet, but the general idea remains.</p><p>When you save a sequence in xLights, you end up with a sequence file which serves the same purpose. This can be distributed to other people who can then use it in their own display. Of course, you can modify the sequence based on differences in display, preferences of colors or timing of patterns, or because you felt like doing something different with the megatree, but the base sequence will remain. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/translate.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Anatomy of a Light Display" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="624" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/translate.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/translate.jpg 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/translate.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>image credits: <a href="https://elevaterockschool.com/read-music-chords-scales/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Elevate Rock School</a>, <a href="https://www.pixelcontroller.com/store/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Pixel Controller.com</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="playing">Playing</h3><p>Once a musician has the sheet music, she reads through it to get a better understanding of how to play. While reading it, her eyes and part of her brain are translating the notation which is written on the pages into sounds, intensity, patterns, and chords, and is also starting to get an idea on how to physically play it. When she decides to sit down at the piano, an additional part of her brain starts to tell her fingers, hands, and feet how to move in order to recreate that which is written on the page.</p><p>Just as there are two things going on in the brain, so there are two different components in a light display. The first component is a player, probably something like a <a href="http://www.falconchristmas.com/wiki/Falcon_FPP?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Falcon Player</a>, which translates the sequence file in the previous stage into some form of meaning. The second component, picks up that meaning and starts telling the lights how to flash. This component is called a controller, and the one I&apos;m using is a <a href="https://www.pixelcontroller.com/store/controllers/51-f4v2-pixel-controller.html?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Falcon F4V3</a>. All the lights are plugged into the ports on this controller (or an extension board with differential receivers; kinda like having a brain in each shoulder as well as one in your head) and all the on/off/color change information for every light is distributed from this component.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/wires.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Anatomy of a Light Display" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/wires.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/wires.jpg 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/wires.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>image credits: <a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20486907/8-signs-you-might-have-nerve-damage/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Prevention.com</a>, <a href="https://www.functionaldevices.com/about/blog/2019/08/how-to-wire-a-multi-tap-transformer/?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">RIB Functional Devices</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="blood-and-nerves">Blood and Nerves</h3><p>In order for our musician&apos;s fingers to move, her muscles need two things: commands on how much and when to flex or relax, and energy to power the muscle&apos;s movements. The commands are sent from her brain to her muscles by way of her nerves, and the energy is contained in blood moving through her blood vessels.</p><p>Both of these jobs are done by wires in our lighting display. The information about how to light up is sent via data or signal cables which end up connecting to the controller discussed above. For power, DC voltage is needed to make the pixels actually light up. In a smaller display, this can come from the same port in a controller, but is likely to come from a separate power distribution board, which we&apos;ll talk about next.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/power.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Anatomy of a Light Display" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/power.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/power.jpg 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/power.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>image credits: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_of_the_human_heart_(cropped).svg?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://lighthouseleds.com/12v-5a-led-power-supply-ac-to-dc-60-watts.html?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Lighthouse LEDs</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="power">Power</h3><p>In our musician&apos;s body, blood takes energy (in the form of glucose) and nutrients around the body, among other things preparing the muscles for activation by signals from the nerves.

For the purposes of this post, we&apos;ll be looking at only one of these circuits, one string of lights coming from one port; let&apos;s call this a run.</p><p>Some of the things which limit a run are the same as with other circuits: fuse(s) on the circuit (there&apos;s usually one built into the board per port), wire gauge, and wire length. On the Falcon F16, the ports have a 5A fuse, so we can&apos;t pass more current than 5A through this run without blowing the fuse. Wire gauge and length is.... complicated, so we&apos;re going to ignore it for the time being.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/Cont_Wire_Chart.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Controller Port Limitations" loading="lazy" width="924" height="697" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Cont_Wire_Chart.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/Cont_Wire_Chart.jpg 924w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>see?</figcaption></figure><p>For <em>typical</em> LEDs, the amperage of each RGB pixel is approx 60mA, or 0.06A. This suggests that we can run about 83 pixels on each port, after which point we risk blowing the fuse on the board.</p><p>This is where things start getting.... weird. If you plugged in a string of 83 pixels and put them to full white (100% brightness to each red, green, and blue pixel), you&apos;ll notice that they look fine... up until around pixel 50 or so, at which point, they start taking on a pinkish hue. Virtually nobody would consider the color the 83rd pixel is emitting &quot;white&quot;.</p><p>The reason for this dimming is because of a phenomenon called voltage drop. As you go down the line, each pixel consumes a little bit of power, which reduces the amount available for each pixel further down the line. This is fine in the beginning as each pixel has more than enough power to work with; a 5V pixel will work fine down to about 4V, for example. After a certain threshold (somewhere around 50 pixels), the pixel is unable to fully power all three LEDs, and thus they each have a lower brightness. There&apos;s a bunch of <a href="http://spikerlights.com/pwrinjection.aspx?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">charts and models</a> you can look at to get a richer understanding, but all you need to know is that this is a thing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Controller Port Limitations" loading="lazy" width="1264" height="1015" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/spiker-lights.JPG 1264w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Credit: http://spikerlights.com/calcpower.aspx</figcaption></figure><p>So that&apos;s two limits: how many pixels a port can provide power to (83 or so) and how many pixels with good color rendering a port can drive (50 or so). Let&apos;s assume that neither of these is a problem. We&apos;ll just avoid physics and say that any number of pixels can be powered without melting the board, and further assume that voltage drop is not a thing. We <em>still</em> will have limits to how many pixels a single port can drive, but this time it&apos;s how many can be updated every frame.</p><p>&quot;Frame&quot; is an animation term, hearkening back to the French &quot;fram&#xEA;z&quot; which means I&apos;m kidding I did literally zero research into the history of this terminology. I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s from photography (a photograph is a frame contained by the borders of the photo) and then was adopted by movies, which are just 24 images per second being shown to you to give an illusion of moving pictures. In animation, particularly in computer animation, it&apos;s a moment which is frozen in time, where some controller or artist has defined exactly what the display should look like for that very brief moment.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/aladdin-genie-mouth-drop.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Controller Port Limitations" loading="lazy" width="480" height="360"><figcaption>An example of a single frame</figcaption></figure><p>This is how pixel displays work. Many times per second, the controller tells every single pixel what color it should be, waits until the next update time, then tells every single pixel what color it should be again. Frame rate simply means &quot;how many frames are shown over time&quot; and is typically measured in frames per second. Refresh rate is directly related to this, but it typically describes how much time elapses between each refresh (frame) of the display and is typically measured in milliseconds or thousandths of a second. Common frame rates are 20fps and 40fps; the former has a refresh rate of 50ms and the latter has a refresh rate of 25ms.</p><p>Back to ports. Each port can only update a certain number of pixels in a given refresh rate time period; this is due to each pixel taking a tiny bit of time to take its portion of the message and pass the rest down the line, the speed of light (how fast the signal moves through the wires to the next pixel), and built-in overhead on the controller to determine what the next frame is going to look like. My controller (Falcon F16V3) can update 1024 pixels per port every frame, but only when running in 20fps; if I want 40fps, I have to drop my pixel count to around 600 pixels since the controller won&apos;t be able to keep up.</p><p>Fortunately, we can solve for two of these three main limitations. We can&apos;t do anything about the maximum number of pixels a single port can update; that&apos;s physics and computers and stuff, and it&apos;s pretty damn impressive that a controller can update 600 different tiny microcomputers (which is what LED pixels really are) across my front yard 40 times every single second. However, we <em>can </em>fix the much more restrictive limits of 50 pixels and 83 pixels by using power injection, and we&apos;ll get into that with the next post.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wiring Notes and Design Prep]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which I describe why writing down wiring details is helpful]]></description><link>http://ghost.wicked.fox/wiring-notes/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62a78a5510ae7100017f6453</guid><category><![CDATA[Pixels]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wiring]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Wickham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 20:04:45 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6077.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6077.jpg" alt="Wiring Notes and Design Prep"><p>One thing I&apos;ve found very helpful when building props is to write down various notes about wiring. Sure, there are going to be some rules or guidelines you should follow (e.g. DC+ goes to DC+, how to manage power injection, etc), but what wire colors are, what connectors you use, whether the male plug is on the incoming side of the prop or on the outgoing, etc. are going to vary based upon your preferences, the types of components you buy, etc.</p><p>To add to the difficulty, sometimes this stuff is not very well documented. For example, for the pixel strands I bought there is no documentation as to whether the signal goes from the male plug to the female plug or vice versa; you have to figure it out on your own.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wiring Notes and Design Prep" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2021/09/IMG_6076-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>What is all this?</figcaption></figure><p>Thus, writing these things down is incredibly helpful. By doing some preliminary thinking and design work, you can simplify the process of wiring and reduce the possibility of bad wiring quite a lot.</p><p>You won&apos;t have to go back and figure out what you&apos;ve already done in order to try and match it. It&apos;s annoying to have to get a fully wired and functional prop out of storage to figure out which direction the current is flowing, which direction the plugs should go, etc. Further, if you always use the same practice for wiring things up, your system is more flexible and open to changes without having to rebuild connectors, etc.</p><p>At a minimum, these are the things I would write down:</p><ul><li>Which wire colors carry what type of current. Do this for pixel strands, other prewired props which need to be connected, signal cables running from the controllers to the props, and power injection.</li><li>What direction connectors face. I find it easiest to think of this as &quot;incoming&quot; and &quot;outgoing&quot;, but it&apos;s also commonly referred to as &quot;upstream&quot; and &quot;downstream&quot; (controller/power source is always &quot;outgoing&quot; or &quot;upstream&quot;). As an example, if you buy the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32739097740.html?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">Ray Wu connectors</a>, it&apos;s common to wire the female plug (holes instead of prongs) to the <a href="https://www.pixelcontroller.com/store/products/57-5mm-connectors.html?ref=ghost.wicked.fox">controller connectors</a> which plug into the board. The direction doesn&apos;t matter as long as it&apos;s consistent.</li><li>Which wires go to which connector poles. This is useful mainly for power injection wires, but it really depends on how in-depth you get with your wiring.</li></ul><p>That&apos;s seems like very little, but do each of these for each of the wire types and it starts getting to be a bit of info. However, I promise that you will appreciate having this when you go months between building props and have completely forgotten which way everything goes.</p><p>For me, it ended up looking something like this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wiring Notes and Design Prep" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 1000w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 1600w, http://ghost.wicked.fox/content/images/size/w2400/2021/09/IMG_6078.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Don&apos;t worry if you can&apos;t read my writing; I&apos;m the only one who need to be able to &#x1F602;</figcaption></figure><p>As for that last bit about not connecting DC+ to signal cables?
