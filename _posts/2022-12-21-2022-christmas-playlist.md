Enjoy, and merry Christmas!

# Tommee Profit - O Come O Come Emmanuel

{% include embed/youtube.html id='xCp6CunpOSI' %}

I really enjoyed this rendition of the song, which itself has always been one of my favorite songs of the season.

# Selena Gomez - Winter Wonderland

{% include embed/youtube.html id='7YobJHmBKqk' %}

This is one of the sequences I had in last year's show. Winter Wonderland is one of my wife's favorite holiday songs, so I decided to bring it into this year's show as well.

# Pentatonix - Hark the Herald Angels Sing

{% include embed/youtube.html id='rZMEuRARrPE' %}

New in the lineup this year, this was a request from my family. While it's great to do songs I like (and I did plenty of that!), I do the show mostly for other people, so listening to what they want to watch is fun.

# Laurie Berkner - Jingle Bells

{% include embed/youtube.html id='UITTemYRkgo' %}

Another request, this time because it's my niece's favorite rendition of this song. This is also the only song I personally sequenced and didn't adapt from a sequence I purchased; I so far have done one per year. I'm looking to do more sequencing for next year; I just had my hands full with the hardware what with the new house

# David Foster - Carol of the Bells

I enjoy this rendition of Carol of the Bells, as may be evident since it's another carry-over from last year. While I really like the song, I may look into a different rendition next year.

# Ariana Grande - Santa Tell Me

{% include embed/youtube.html id='sJ-fk2Enx2k' %}

Not gonna lie, I heard this on a Spotify Christmas playlist and enjoyed it, so I hunted the sequence down. However, I did quite a bit of modification once I downloaded the sequence; it's probably the most customized purchased sequence I have!

# John Williams - Harry Potter Medley

{% include embed/youtube.html id='yIc4AT5Rkl0' %}

This was one of the more popular sequences from last year, so it earned a spot in this year's show. I mean, it doesn't hurt that John Williams is a genius, and the sequence was designed by one of the better sequencers in the hobby: Tom BetGeorge
