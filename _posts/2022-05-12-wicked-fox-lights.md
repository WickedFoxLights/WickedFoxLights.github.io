It's been a busy winter! While setting up and running the show for Christmas, we were busy buying a home in Benicia, about 60 miles north from San Jose. As of April 2022, we are now in the new home and have sold the San Jose home. Exciting!

Since the previous name of the light show was directly tied to the street, a change of name is warranted. Wicked Fox is inspired by our last names and we've used it in a variety of contexts, so it feels natural to use it here as well. That way, if/when we move again, we won't have to change the name of the website or anything.

Glenmont Lights is dead! Long live Wicked Fox Lights!
