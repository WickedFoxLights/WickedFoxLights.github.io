Enjoy, and merry Christmas!

# John Williams - Harry Potter Medley

{% include embed/youtube.html id='Eb2Nby3QS7U' %}

This one is a family favorite, between John Williams' great music and the excellent sequencing by Magical Light Shows

# Neoclassic - Christmas Dubstep

{% include embed/youtube.html id='BHJisCTeKu8' %}

Not your typical Christmas song, but then again, this isn't your typical Christmas lights either.

# Selena Gomez - Winter Wonderland

{% include embed/youtube.html id='psxFW6bel_A' %}

One of my wife's favorites, and I like this version too, so it found its way into the show

# tobyMac - Little Drummer Boy

{% include embed/youtube.html id='hSyHRM0NTl8' %}

This was always one of my favorite carols growing up, and I really loved the sequencing for this (again, Magical Light Shows)

# Sia - Candy Cane Lane

{% include embed/youtube.html id='B-_74teKEiI' %}

I really like the calling out of colors in the song along with the lights changing

# Leo Moracchioli - All I Want For Christmas Is You

{% include embed/youtube.html id='Qong_5IfM1c' %}

I designed this sequence and matching the frenetic energy of the song was not easy, but I'm happy with the result

# David Foster - Carol of the Bells

{% include embed/youtube.html id='i_rfUyFU83s' %}

Carol of the Bells is a great song and this version is pretty good; the sequence makes great use of the hits

Hope you enjoyed; thanks for reading!
